            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>HAving been perſuaded to put together ſome ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Notes, which I long ago made upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Places of Holy Scripture, I began the laſt Year to conſider ſome Texts in the Book of <hi>GE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESIS.</hi> Where I ſoon found there would be a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of making an entire Commentary, upon a good part of it: And therefore I reſolved to go through the whole, in the ſame manner as I had done the Three firſt Chapters.</p>
            <p>After I had finiſhed the better half of my Work, I was informed that <hi>Monſ. l'Clerk</hi> had publiſhed a <hi>Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Commentary</hi> upon the ſame Book: But whether I have concurred in any thing with him, or contradicted him, I am not able to ſay; having wanted leiſure to peruſe his Work, by reaſon of the Publick Buſineſs, which came upon me in the end of the Year. When I likewiſe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that a very Learned Friend and Brother had put <pb facs="tcp:50230:4"/> into the Preſs, <hi>Annotations</hi> upon all the Five Books of <hi>Moſes.</hi> But by communicating ſome of our Papers to each other, we found there would be no reaſon, that either of us ſhould lay aſide our Deſign; but go on, in our ſeveral ways, to make the Scriptures better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, by all ſorts of Perſons: For all helps are little enough in this Age; which ſeems to take pleaſure in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ignorant of the moſt important Truths.</p>
            <p>In which we are ſo particularly inſtructed by
<hi>Moſes,</hi> as by no other Author, nor by all the Authors that are, or have been known to be, extant in the World. For to him we owe the Knowledge of the beginning of the World; of the firſt Parents of Mankind; the Inventors of Arts; the Original of Nations; the Founders of Kingdoms and Empires; the Inſtitution of Laws; the Fountain of Religious Rites; Yea, of all the ancient Mythology; and, which is moſt conſiderable, the means of propagating that Senſe of God and of Religion, which Mankind brought into the World with them; and how it came to be corrupted.</p>
            <p>There have been thoſe who have taken the liberty to ſay, That it is impoſſible to give any tolerable Account of the <hi>Creation</hi> of the World, in Six Days; of the Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Paradiſe;</hi> the Fall of our firſt Parents, by the ſeduction of a <hi>Serpent,</hi> &amp;c. But, I hope, I have made it appear, there is no ground for ſuch preſumptuous Words: But very good reaſon to believe every thing <pb facs="tcp:50230:4"/> that
<hi>Moſes</hi> hath related; without forſaking the <hi>literal</hi> Sence, and betaking our ſelves to, I do not know what, <hi>Allegorical</hi> Interpretations. Particularly, I find the Truth of what I have noted concerning
<hi>Paradiſe,</hi> very much confirmed by a Learned and Judicious Diſcourſe of <hi>Monſ. Huetius;</hi> which I did not meet withal till I had made an end of theſe <hi>Commentaries:</hi> But then took a review of what I had written, and found cauſe to correct what I had noted out of Mr.
<hi>Carver,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Spring of <hi>Tigris</hi> and
<hi>Euphrates.</hi> I might alſo have given a clearer Account of the
<hi>Deluge,</hi> if I had obſerved ſome things; which are come to my notice ſince theſe Papers went to the Preſs: But, I hope, I have ſaid enough to evince that it is not ſo incredible, as ſome have pretended. For, having made the largeſt Conceſſions concerning the heighth of the higheſt Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, which, according to the old Opinion, I have allowed may be
<hi>thirty</hi> Miles high, <hi>Gen. VII. 19.</hi> (whereas if inſtead of
<hi>thirty,</hi> I had ſaid not above <hi>three</hi> perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular, I had had the beſt of the Modern Philoſophers to defend me) it appears there might be Water enough to cover the loftieſt of them; as <hi>Moſes</hi> hath related.</p>
            <p>Whoſe account of the Families by whom the Earth was Peopled after the Flood, is ſo ſurpriſingly agreeable to all the Records that remain in any Language, of the ſeveral Nations of the Earth; that it carries with it an uncontroulable Evidence of his Sincerity and Truth, as <pb facs="tcp:50230:5"/> well as of his admirable Univerſal Knowledge. For as there is no Writer that hath given us an Account of ſo many Nations, and ſo remote as he hath done: So he hath not ſatisfied himſelf with naming them; but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted us with their original; and told us at what time, and from what place, and on what occaſion they were diſperſed into far diſtant Countries. And this with ſuch brevity, that he hath informed us of more in one Chapter, than we can find in the great Volumes of ill other Authors: Having ſhown us from whom all
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hoſe People deſcended, who are ſpread over the Face of the Earth, from the <hi>Caſpian</hi> and
<hi>Perſian</hi> Sea, to <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi> his Pillars (as the Ancients ſpeak) that is, all the World over.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, whatſoever is moſt ancient in thoſe Countries, which are furtheſt from all Commerce with his own, is clearly explained by
<hi>Moſes:</hi> Whoſe Writings therefore cannot but be highly valued, by all thoſe who will apply their Minds ſeriouſly to the ſtudy of them. For if they, who now have no regard to him, would but compare what he hath written on the fore named Subject, with what they find in thoſe Heathen Writers, whom they have in the greateſt veneration, they would be forced to confeſs him to be a Man of wonderful Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and could not reaſonably doubt he had an exact knowledge of the Truth of thoſe things, whereof he wrote. To this purpoſe, I remember, the famous <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chartus</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:50230:5"/> ſpeaks; who hath given the greateſt light to the
<hi>Tenth</hi> of <hi>Geneſis;</hi> wherein theſe things are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered.</p>
            <p>And truly, it is ſome wonder, That they who ſo much cry up the
<hi>Egyptian</hi> Learning, ſhould not eaſily grant (unleſs they will believe all Hiſtorians but only thoſe whom we account Sacred) that
<hi>Moſes</hi> muſt needs be qualified, even without the help of Divine Revelation (which he certainly had) to write both of <hi>their</hi> Original, and of all thoſe who were related to them: Being bred up in their Country; nay, in their Court till he was <hi>XL</hi> Years old; and well verſed in all the Wiſdom, that was to be found among them, <hi>Acts VII. 22.</hi> Which Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of theirs, I doubt not, was much augmented by <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s living among them, (as I have obſerved upon <hi>XIII. 2.</hi>) but eſpecially by <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s long Government of that Country, for the ſpace of <hi>LXXX</hi> Years: Who was indued with ſuch an incomparable Spirit, that the wiſeſt Men among them learnt of him; for he <hi>taught their Senators Wiſdom,</hi> Pſalm <hi>CV. 22.</hi> And, in like manner,
<hi>Moſes</hi> lived <hi>XL</hi> Years more among the <hi>Midianites,</hi> where, it appears by <hi>Jethro,</hi> there wanted not Perſons of great Knowledge. And from thence he might eaſily be inſtructed in all that the
<hi>Arabians</hi> knew: Who were no mean People (it appears by the Story of
<hi>Job</hi> and his three Friends, and <hi>Elihu,</hi> who is ſuppoſed by ſome to have wrote that admirable Book) <pb facs="tcp:50230:6"/> and were near Neighbours to the moſt famous Nations of the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Countries; From whom, it is evident by this Hiſtory, all Learning, Arts, and Sciences origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally came.</p>
            <p>I could add a great deal more to this purpoſe; but the Reader, I hope, will find enough to ſatisfie him in the <hi>Commentary</hi> it ſelf. And therefore I ſhall only make this one Requeſt to him; That he would take his <hi>Bible</hi> and read every Verſe intirely along with this
<hi>Commentary:</hi> For I have not ſet down every Word of the Text, for fear of ſwelling this Work unto too great a Bulk.</p>

            <head>A COMMENTARY UPON THE Firſt Book of <hi>MOSES,</hi> CALLED GENESIS.</head>
            <div n="1" type="chapter">
               <p>THat <hi>MOSES</hi> wrote this and the Four fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Books hath been ſo conſtantly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, both by <hi>Jews, Chriſtians,</hi> and
<hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> that none, I think, denied it, till <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> (a Jewiſh Doctor, who lived not much above <hi>five</hi> hundred Years ago) raiſed ſome Doubts about it, in his Notes upon the <hi>Firſt</hi> of
<hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> out of XII Paſſages in theſe Books themſelves: Which he pretended could not be his, but the Words of a later Author. But when I meet with thoſe places, I ſhall make it appear, that all ſuch exceptions are very frivolous, and ought not to ſhake our belief of this Truth, That theſe <hi>Five</hi> Books were penned by <hi>MOSES</hi> and no Body elſe.</p>
               <p>The firſt is called <hi>GENESIS,</hi> becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, the Hiſtory of the Creation of the World, with <pb n="2" facs="tcp:50230:8" rendition="simple:additions"/> which it begins; and the Genealogy of the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, down to the death of
<hi>Joſeph,</hi> where it ends. It comprehends an Hiſtory of Two thouſand three hundred and ſixty nine Years, or thereabouts: The truth of all which it was not difficult for <hi>Moſes</hi> to know, becauſe it came down to his time, through but a very few Hands. For from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Noah,</hi> there was one Man (<hi>Methuſelah</hi>) who lived ſo long as to ſee them both. And ſo it was from <hi>Noah</hi> to <hi>Abraham: Shem</hi> converſed with both. As <hi>Iſaac</hi> did with <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Joſeph:</hi> From whom theſe things might eaſily be conveyed to <hi>Moſes,</hi> by
<hi>Amram;</hi> who lived long enough with <hi>Joſeph.</hi> In ſhort,
<hi>Moſes</hi> might have been confuted, if he had written any thing but the Truth, by learned Men of other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who ſprang from the ſame Root, and had the like means of being acquainted with the great things here reported by tradition from their Fore-fathers: Who lived ſo long in the beginning of the World, that they more certainly tranſmitted things to their Poſterity. Beſides, it is not reaſonable to think, they had not the uſe of
<hi>Writing</hi> as we have; whereby they conveyed the knowledge of Times foregoing, to thoſe that came after.</p>
               <p>Verſe 1. <hi>In the beginning.</hi>] The World is not eternal, but had a beginning, as all Philoſophers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged before
<hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> So he himſelf informs us, <hi>L.</hi> 1. <hi>de Coelo, cap.</hi> 2. (ſpeaking of the ancient Opinions concerning the Original of the World) <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>they all ſay it had a beginning:</hi> But ſome thought it might have no End; others judged it to be Corruptible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God created.</hi>] He who is Eternal gave a Being to this great Fabrick of Heaven and Earth, out of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. <pb n="3" facs="tcp:50230:8"/> It is obſerved by <hi>Euſebius</hi> (in the beginning of his Book <hi>De Praepar. Evang. p.</hi> 21, <hi>&amp;</hi> 25. <hi>Edit. Pariſ.</hi>) That neither the ancient <hi>Hiſtorians,</hi> nor the <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> do ſo much as mention GOD, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, no, not ſo far as to name him, when they write of the beginning of the World. But this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Law-giver, deſigning to hang the whole Frame of his Polity, upon Piety towards GOD, and to make the Creator of all, the Founder of his Laws, begins with him. Not after the manner of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> and
<hi>Phoenicians,</hi> who beſtowed this adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Name, upon a great Multitude: But puts in the Front of his Work, the Name of the ſole Cauſe of all things; the Maker of whatſoever is ſeen or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen. As if he had told the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Nation, That he who gave them the Law contained in theſe Books, was the King and Law-giver of the whole World: Which was, like a great City, governed by him. Whom therefore he would have them look upon, not only as the Enacter of their Laws; but of thoſe alſo which all Nature obeys. See
<hi>L.</hi> VII. <hi>De Praepar. Evang. c.</hi> 9, 10. <hi>&amp; L.</hi> XII.
<hi>c.</hi> 16.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Heaven and the Earth.</hi>] The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Particle
<hi>Eth,</hi> put before both <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> ſignifies as much as <hi>with,</hi> if <hi>Maimonides</hi> underſtood it aright; and makes the Sence to be this: <hi>He created the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, with all things in the Heavens,</hi> and the Earth with all <hi>things in the Earth;</hi> as his Words are in <hi>More Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vochim,</hi> P. II. cap. 30. Certain it is theſe two words, <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> comprehend the whole vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible World. Some would have the <hi>Angels</hi> compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in the word
<hi>Heaven;</hi> particularly <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> Haereſ. LXV. n. 45.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. But others of the Fathers are of a different <pb n="4" facs="tcp:50230:9"/> Opinion, as <hi>Petavius</hi> there obſerves. It is a pretty Conceit of <hi>Theophilus Antiochenus,</hi> L. 2. <hi>ad Autolycum,</hi> That the <hi>Heavens</hi> are mentioned before the
<hi>Earth,</hi> to ſhow that God's Works are not like ours: For he begins at the top, we at the bottom: That is, he firſt made the <hi>fixed Stars</hi> and all beyond them, (fo I take the word <hi>Heaven</hi> here to ſignifie) for they had a beginning, as well as this lower World, though they do not ſeem to be comprehended in the <hi>ſix days Work,</hi> which relates only to this <hi>Planetary World,</hi> as I may call it, which hath the <hi>Sun</hi> for its Center. And thus <hi>Philo</hi> underſtood the firſt word
<hi>Bereſchith,</hi> in the beginning, to reſpect the order wherein things were created. God began his Creation with the <hi>Heaven,</hi> as the moſt noble Body, and then proceeded to the <hi>Earth;</hi> an account of which follows.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>And the Earth was without form,</hi> &amp;c.] Some connect this Verſe with the foregoing, by tranſlating the firſt Verſe in this manner, <hi>When God firſt created,</hi> or began to create, <hi>the Heaven and the Earth,</hi> the Earth was without form, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That is, at firſt he only created a rude Matter of thoſe things, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards were faſhioned as we now ſee them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Without form.</hi>] A confuſed, indigeſted heap, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any order or ſhape.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And void.</hi>] Having no Beaſts, nor Trees, nor Herbs, nor any thing elſe, wherewith we now behold it adorned.</p>
               <p>So theſe two words, <hi>Tohu Vabohu,</hi> are uſed in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, where we meet with them (which is not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten) for
<hi>confuſion</hi> and <hi>emptineſs,</hi> XXXIV <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 11. IV
<hi>Jer.</hi> 23. Being a deſcription of that which the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients called the CHAOS (of which the <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> had a Notion, no leſs than the
<hi>Greeks</hi>) wherein <pb n="5" facs="tcp:50230:9"/> the Seeds and Principles of all things were blended together. This is called, in the <hi>Pagan</hi> Language, by <hi>Epicharmus,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the firſt of the Gods: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all things ſprang out of this; which was indeed the firſt of the Works of God, who, as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhows in the ſequel, produced this beautiful World out of this CHAOS.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And darkneſs was upon the face of the deep.</hi>] No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was to be ſeen, for want of Light: Which lay buried, as all things elſe did, in that great Abyſs, or vaſt confuſed heap of Matter before-mentioned. So the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <hi>Tehom</hi> ſignifies (which we trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late <hi>deep</hi>) <hi>tumult and turbid confuſion:</hi> The firſt Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being very <hi>heterogeneous,</hi> as they ſpeak, <hi>i. e.</hi> of various ſorts and kinds, hudled together without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the Spirit of God moved.</hi>] Men have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly fanſiful in the expoſition of theſe plain Words: Some underſtanding by the Spirit of God, the <hi>Sun,</hi> which gives Spirit and Life to all things up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth; others the <hi>Air,</hi> or the <hi>Wind:</hi> When as yet there was no <hi>Sun</hi> in the Firmament, nor any <hi>Wind</hi> that could ſtir, without the Power of the Almighty to excite it. This therefore we are to underſtand to be here meant; The Infinite Wiſdom, and Power of God, which made a vehement Commotion, and mighty Fermentation (by raiſing, perhaps, a great Wind) <hi>upon the face of the Waters:</hi> That is, on that fluid Matter before-mentioned, to ſeparate the parts of it one from the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Waters.</hi>] That which <hi>Moſes</hi> before called the
<hi>Deep,</hi> he now calls <hi>the Waters:</hi> Which plainly ſhows that ſome Parts of the confuſed Maſs, were <hi>fluid</hi> and <hi>light;</hi> as other Parts were <hi>ſolid</hi> and <hi>heavy.</hi> The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50230:10"/> naturally ſunk, which he calls the <hi>Earth;</hi> and the lighter Parts got above them, which he calls the <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:</hi> For it is clearly intimated the <hi>Waters</hi> were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt.</p>
               <p>The Word we here tranſlate <hi>moved,</hi> ſignifies lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally <hi>brooded</hi> upon the Waters, as an Hen doth upon her Eggs. So the ancient and modern Interpreters have obſerved: And <hi>Morinus,</hi> who oppoſes it, hath ſaid nothing to make us doubt of this Sence of the Phraſe. From whence ſome have, not unhappily, conjectured, the Ancients took their Notion of a <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>a firſt laid Egg,</hi> out of which all things were formed. That is, the CHAOS (out of which all the old Philoſophers, before <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> thought the World was produced) conſiſting of <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Water,</hi> of thicker and thinner Parts, as an Egg doth of <hi>Yolk</hi> and
<hi>White.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> thus moved upon the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that by its incubation (as we may call it) it might not only ſeparate, as I ſaid, thoſe Parts which were jumbled together; but give a vivifick Virtue to them, to produce what was contained in them. The Souls and Spirits, that is, of all living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, were produced by the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> as
<hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyry</hi> ſaith <hi>Numenius</hi> underſtood it. For his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he tells us, was, That all things came out of the Water

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, becauſe it was <hi>not yet collected in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Body, as it is now in the Sun.</hi> Others think it to have been a dimmer ſort of Light from the Sun, not yet perfectly formed.
<hi>Abarbinel</hi> (upon the XL of <hi>Exodus</hi>) takes this to be the
<hi>SCHECHINAH,</hi> the moſt excellent of all created things, called, in Holy Scripture, <hi>the Glory of the</hi> LORD; which God, ſaith he, ſealed up in his Treaſures, after the <hi>Lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries</hi> were created, to ſerve him upon ſpecial Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, (for inſtance, to lead the
<hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Wilderneſs, by a cloudy Pillar of Fire) when he would make himſelf appear extraordinarily Preſent. And becauſe of the Perfection of <hi>this Light</hi> he fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies it is that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſays in the next Verſe, That <hi>God ſaw the Light</hi> (repeating the word <hi>Light</hi>) <hi>that it was good:</hi> Whereas in all the reſt of the Six Days Work, he only ſays, He <hi>ſaw it was good,</hi> without naming again the thing he had made.</p>
               <p>But it ſeems to me moſt rational by this <hi>Light,</hi> to underſtand, thoſe Particles of Matter, which we call <hi>Fire,</hi> (whoſe two Properties, every one knows, are <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Heat</hi>) which the Almighty Spirit that formed all things, produced as the great Inſtrument, for the Preparation and digeſtion of the reſt of the Matter; which was ſtill more vigorouſly moved and agitated, from the top to the bottom, by this reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <pb n="10" facs="tcp:50230:12"/> Element, till the purer and more ſhining Parts of it, being ſeparated from the groſſer, and united in a Body fit to retain them, became <hi>Light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>And God ſaw the Light, that it was good.</hi>] He was pleaſed in this Work of his, as agreeable to his Deſign. Which for the preſent was (we may conceive) to influence the upper Parts of the CHA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OS, and to be the Inſtrument of Rarefaction, Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and all the reſt of the Operations, which were neceſſary to mold it into ſuch Creatures, as were afterwards made out of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And God divided the Light from the Darkneſs.</hi>] Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed that they ſhould conſtantly ſucceed one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; as we ſee they do <hi>now,</hi> that this Light is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodied in the Sun; and as they did
<hi>then,</hi> by the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Motion of this firſt Light of Fire, round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the CHAOS, in the ſpace of Twenty-four Hours; which made it Day to thoſe Parts where it ſhined; and Night, where it did not. It is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able how <hi>Moſes</hi> aſcribes every thing to GOD, the Former of all things; who by making this Light move round about the <hi>Chaos,</hi> ſtill more prepared, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted the remaining indigeſted Parts of Matter, for their ſeveral uſes.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>And God called the light, Day; and the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he called, Night.</hi>] He ſetled them (that is) in ſuch a conſtant Courſe, that it gave them theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Names.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the Evening and the Morning were the firſt Day.</hi>] In the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language, <hi>Evening and Morning</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie a whole Day; which the Motion of this Light made, if we conceive it to have been formed about Noon, and to have gone round the fore-mentioned Heap of Matter in Twenty-four Hours.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:50230:12"/>How long all things continued in mere Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, after the CHAOS was created, before this <hi>Light</hi> was extracted out of it, we are not told. It might be (for any thing that is here revealed) a great while; and all that time the mighty Spirit was making ſuch Motions in it, as prepared, diſpoſed, and ripened every Part of it, for ſuch Productions as were to appear ſucceſſively in ſuch ſpaces of time, as are here, and afterward mentioned by <hi>Moſes;</hi> who informs us, That after Things were ſo digeſted, and made ready (by long fermentations perhaps) to be wrought into Form, God produced every day, for ſix days together, ſome Creature or other, till all was finiſhed; of which
<hi>Light</hi> was the very firſt. This <hi>Maimonides</hi> hath very happily illuſtrated, in his <hi>More Nevochim,</hi> P. II. c. 30. where he obſerving that all things were created at once, and then were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſeparated one from another ſucceſſively; he ſays, their wiſe Men reſemble this proceeding to that of a Husbandman, who ſows ſeveral Seeds in the Earth at the ſame moment; ſome of which are to come up after one day, others after two, and others not till three days be paſt; though the whole ſowing was in one and the ſame moment. Thus God made all things at the firſt, which did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear together; but, in the ſpace of <hi>ſix Days,</hi> were formed and put in order one after another: <hi>Light</hi> being the Work of the firſt Day.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>And God ſaid, Let there be a firmament.</hi>] The next thing that God commanded to come forth of the <hi>Chaos,</hi> was the

This appeared afterwards in the Deluge, which was partly made by continued Rains for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny days. The great Objection againſt this Expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, That now there were no Clouds, neither had it, after this, rained on the Earth, <hi>Gen.</hi> II. 6. But it muſt be conſidered, That neither were the Waters, below, as yet gathered into one place: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Moſes</hi> here ſpeaks of the <hi>Air,</hi> as a Body intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be ſtretched between the Waters above and beneath, when they ſhould be formed.</p>
               <p>That the Clouds above are called Waters in the Scripture-Language, is plain enough from <hi>Pſalm</hi> CIV. 3. <hi>Jer.</hi> X. 13. and other places.</p>

<hi>Light</hi> which rowled about the CHAOS, and that <hi>Heat</hi> which was excited within it; whereby ſuch Exhalations were raiſed, as made the
<hi>Firmament.</hi> That is, the thicker Parts of them made this Region of the

So all above the Earth is called, as appears by the following part of the
<hi>Chapter,</hi> in the <hi>Verſes</hi> now mentioned. And that's the very import of the word <hi>Schamaim,</hi> which, in the <hi>Arabick</hi> Language, (as <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> obſerves) ſignifies <hi>heighth</hi> or

<hi>God ſaw that it was good.</hi> What the reaſon of this ſhould be, is enquired by all Interpreters; and the moſt ſolid Account that I can find of it, is this; That the <hi>Waters</hi> mentioned upon this Day, were not yet ſeparated and diſtinguiſhed from the <hi>Earth:</hi> And therefore in the next Day's Work, when he did ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Waters together, <hi>verſe</hi> 10. and when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Earth (which was become dry) to bring forth,
<hi>verſe</hi> 1.2. theſe words, <hi>God ſaw that it was good,</hi> are twice repeated. Which made <hi>Picherellus</hi> and <hi>Ger.

               <p>There being ſuch large portions of Matter drawn out of the CHAOS, as made the Body of <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Air</hi> before-mentioned, there remained in a great Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, only <hi>Water</hi> and <hi>Earth;</hi> but they ſo jumbled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that they could not be diſtinguiſhed. It was the Work therefore of the <hi>third Day,</hi> to make a ſeparation between them; by compacting together all the Particles which make the Earth, which before was Mud and Dirt; and then, by raiſing it above the Waters which covered its Superficies, (as the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt</hi> alſo deſcribes this Work, <hi>Pſalm</hi> CIV. 6.) and, <hi>laſtly,</hi> by making ſuch Caverns in it, as were ſufficient to receive the Waters into them. Now this we may conceive to have been done by ſuch Particles of Fire as were left in the Bowels of the Earth: Whereby ſuch Nitro-ſulphureous Vapours were kindled, as made an Earthquake; which both lifted up the Earth, and alſo made Receptacles for the Waters to run into; as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> (otherwiſe I ſhould not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to mention this) ſeems in the fore-mentioned place to illuſtrate it, <hi>Pſalm</hi> CIV. 7. where he ſays, <hi>At thy rebuke they</hi> (i. e. the Waters) <hi>fled; at the voice of thy thunder they haſted away.</hi> And ſo God himſelf ſpeaks,
<hi>Job</hi> XXXVIII. 10. <hi>I brake up for it</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> for the Sea) <hi>my decreed place, and ſet bars, and doors.</hi> Hiſtories alſo tell us, of Mountains that have been, in ſeveral Ages, lifted up by Earthquakes; nay, <pb n="15" facs="tcp:50230:14"/> Iſlands in the midſt of the Sea: Which confirms this Conjecture, That poſſibly the Waters were, at the firſt, ſeparated by this means; and ſo ſeparated, that they ſhould not return to cover the Earth. For the Word, in the beginning of this
<hi>Verſe,</hi> which we tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate <hi>gathered,</hi> comes from
<hi>Kav,</hi> which ſignifies a <hi>Square,</hi> a <hi>Rule,</hi> or

               <p>This Work of God (whereby the Waters were ſent down into their proper Channels, and the Earth made dry, and fitted for the habitation of ſuch Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as were afterwards created) is obſerved by <hi>Strabo</hi> in his <hi>Geography,</hi> as an act of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, <hi>L.</hi> XVII.

Thus
<hi>Moſes</hi> gives a plain Account of the firſt Production of things, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the natural Method: For ſuppoſing they <pb n="17" facs="tcp:50230:15"/> had a Beginning, the <hi>Herb</hi> and the <hi>Tree</hi> muſt natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be before the <hi>Seed</hi> they bear: As the Hen is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Egg ſhe lays. And to make a Queſtion, which was firſt (as ſome of the Philoſophers did) is very frivolous; becauſe that Power which alone could produce the Seeds of all things, could as eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make the things themſelves, with a power to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page their kind, by Seed.</p>
               <p>It is therefore moſt judiciouſly noted by
<hi>Abarbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,</hi> a learned <hi>Jew,</hi> That the Production of Plants in the beginning, differed from their Production ever ſince in theſe two things: <hi>Firſt,</hi> That they have ſprung ever ſince out of
<hi>Seed,</hi> either ſown by us, or falling from the Plants themſelves; but at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning were brought out of the Earth, with their Seed in them, to propage them ever after. And, <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> They need now, as they have done ſince the firſt Creation, the influence of the Sun, to make them ſprout: But then they came forth by the Power of God, before there was any Sun, which was not form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till the next Day.

<hi>Moon,</hi> which inlightens us by Night. The <hi>Moon</hi> indeed is not ſo <hi>great</hi> as the reſt of the Planets, (for it is the leaſt of all, except <hi>Mercury,</hi>) but it affords the greateſt Light to us; by reflecting the Beams of the Sun to us, in its abſence; and thereby very much abating the diſconſolate darkneſs of the Night.</p>

<hi>ſet</hi> or appointed by his Order, to give us Light: And therefore he alone is to be worſhipped, not they.</p>
               <p>It is commonly taken notice of, that there is no mention of the Creation of Angels, in all this Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; nor was there any need of it. For the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Idolatry conſiſting in the worſhip of the Sun, Moon, and Stars, (as appears from the very Names of the moſt ancient <hi>Idols</hi> in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Moloch, Aſhtaroth,</hi> and the like,) which they believed to be eternal Beings: The great Deſign of
<hi>Moſes</hi> 
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:50230:17"/> was to confute this Opinion, by repreſenting them (over and over) as the Work of the Eternal God; which ſtruck at the very Root of <hi>Idolatry.</hi> The wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of
<hi>Angels</hi> was a later invention.</p>
               <p>Ver. 18. <hi>And to rule over the day, and over the Night.</hi>] Some have fanſied, that the ancient Idolatry ſprung from this word
<hi>Rule:</hi> Men looking upon theſe glorious Lights, as having a dominion over them. Whence the Sun was called <hi>Baal,</hi> that is, Lord, or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, by the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> People; and <hi>Moloch,</hi> that is, King, by the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> But one word ſure was not the ground of ſo foul an Error; when the ſcope of <hi>Moſes</hi> was to ſhow that theſe things were <hi>made</hi> by an higher Being, and made not to rule over
<hi>Men,</hi> but over the <hi>Day</hi> and the <hi>Night;</hi> which the Sun makes when it riſes and ſets, by the order and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And God ſaw that it was good.</hi>] He was pleaſed with this Work, as ſuitable to the Ends for which he intended it. The firſt Light <hi>was good</hi> (<hi>ver.</hi> 4.) for the purpoſe to which it ſerved; which was, by its heat, to agitate, rarefie, and ſeparate the Matter of the CHAOS, for the making of <hi>Air,</hi> and gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together the <hi>Waters,</hi> and drying the <hi>Earth,</hi> and producing <hi>Graſs, Herbs,</hi> and <hi>Trees;</hi> which made it neceſſary it ſhould continue ſome Days near to the Earth, that it might powerfully penetrate into the Matter it was to digeſt: But, if it ſhould have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued longer ſo near to the Earth, it would <hi>not have been good</hi> for it; becauſe it would have burnt up all the Plants, that the Earth had brought forth; and, by its too ſcorching heat, have hindred the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of thoſe living Creatures, which were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy on the next Day to be made; or, at leaſt, made
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50230:17"/> the Earth unfit for their habitation. For the
<hi>Air,</hi> which all living things, even Fiſhes themſelves, need, (nay, the Plants alſo, which have Veſſels for conveying Air to all their Parts,) would have been ſo very hot, that it would have afforded no refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to them: Therefore <hi>it was good</hi> that it ſhould be advanced into the Firmament of the Heaven, and there embodied in thoſe Luminaries, which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing removed further from us, give ſuch a moderate heat, as is neceſſary for the preſervation of us, and of all things living that dwell upon the Earth.</p>

               <p>Ver. 20. <hi>And God ſaid, Let the Waters,</hi> &amp;c.] Now God proceeded to form the lower ſort of <hi>Animals,</hi> or living Creatures, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Fiſh,</hi> and the <hi>Fowl;</hi> which are in many reſpects inferior to <hi>Beaſts.</hi> And the Fiſhes are called
<hi>moving</hi> (in the <hi>Hebrew, creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>) Creatures; becauſe their Bellies touch the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as creeping things do the Earth. Both Fiſhes and Fowls were made out of the <hi>Waters;</hi> that is, out of ſuch Matter as was mixed with the Waters, which contained in them many things beſides ſimple Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for the Sea and Rivers are ſtill very richly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with various Compounds, for the nouriſhment of an innumerable multitude of Fiſhes. The great congruity that there is between Fiſh and Fowl in many particulars, will not let us doubt they had the ſame Original: For they are both <hi>oviparous,</hi> which makes them more fruitful than the Beaſts of the Earth; neither of them have any <hi>Teats;</hi> they both direct, (and, as I may ſay, <hi>ſteer</hi>) their Courſe by their Tail, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> See <hi>Ger.

The formation of theſe Creatures is, in every part of them, very won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, eſpecially in thoſe parts whereby they are fitted to ſwim, and to fly. Which demonſtrate a moſt wiſe Agent, by whoſe infinite Power they were ſo contrived, as to be able alſo to propagate their Kind.</p>
               <p>Ver. 21. <hi>And God created great Whales.</hi>] The vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of theſe Creatures, perhaps, made <hi>Moſes</hi> again uſe the word <hi>Create,</hi> (which he had not done ſince the beginning of the
<hi>Chapter,</hi> not becauſe they were made as the CHAOS was, out of Nothing; but becauſe it required a greater Power to make out of the precedent Matter, moving things of ſo huge a Bulk, and of ſuch great Agility, than to make any other thing hitherto formed.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <hi>Tanim,</hi> which we tranſlate

For <hi>Job Ludolphus,</hi> I think, hath demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, that nothing but the <hi>Crocodile</hi> can be meant by this word <hi>Tanim,</hi> in <hi>Ezek.</hi> XXIX. 3. and XXXII. 2. and ſome other places.

<hi>Fiſhes,</hi> whoſe Fins ſerve them to ſwim in the Water; and of
<hi>Water-Fowl,</hi> whoſe Feet are formed ſo, as to ſerve for the ſame uſe; and ſome of them (ſuch as dive under Water) co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered ſo thick with Feathers, and thoſe ſo ſmooth and ſlippery, (as the Learned and Pious Mr. <hi>Ray</hi> hath obſerved) that their Bodies are thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended from the cold of the Water; which cannot penetrate or moiſten them. See
<hi>Wiſdom of God in the Creation,</hi> P. I. p. 135.</p>
               <p>Ver. 22. <hi>And God bleſſed them,</hi> &amp;c.] His bleſſing them, was giving them a Power to Multiply and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, till they had filled the Water with Fiſh, and the Air with Fowl. Which required a particular Care of Divine Providence, as <hi>Abarbinel</hi> obſerves; becauſe they do not bring forth young Ones per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly formed, as the Beaſts do; but lay their Eggs in which they are formed, when they are out of their Bodies. This, ſaith he, is a wonderful thing, That when the Womb, as we may call it, is ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from the Genitor, a living Creature like it ſelf ſhould be produced. Which is the reaſon, he fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, that <hi>a Bleſſing</hi> is here pronounced upon them, and not on the Beaſts, that were made the next Day. The ancient Fathers are wont to obſerve, That the
<hi>firſt Bleſſing</hi> was given to the Waters, as a Type of Baptiſm.

I do not know whether there be any weight in the Note of <hi>Abarbinel,</hi> who obſerves that <hi>Moſes</hi> here uſes a new word, which we tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate <hi>bring forth;</hi> to ſhow the difference between <hi>Plants</hi> and <hi>Animals.</hi> The former of which ſpring out of the Earth indeed, but continue fix'd in it, and periſh if they be ſeparated from it: Whereas <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,</hi> though made out of the Earth, and living up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, have a ſeparate exiſtence, and do not ſtill ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>After his kind.</hi>] Three ſorts of living Creatures are immediately mentioned, which were formed out of ſuch Matter, as the Earth afforded, (not ſimple Earth, we muſt underſtand, no more than before ſimple Water; for it was impregnated with many other Principles;) the firſt of which, <hi>Behemah,</hi> which we tranſlate <hi>Cattle,</hi> always ſignifies the Flocks and Herds of tame Beaſts, when it is diſtinguiſhed from <hi>Chaja,</hi> which we tranſlate in the end of the <hi>Verſe, Beaſts of the Earth,</hi> that is, wild Beaſts: Between which two, he mentions a <hi>third</hi> kind of living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures on the Earth, which he calls <hi>Remeſh, creeping things;</hi> becauſe whatever Feet they have, they are ſo ſhort and ſmall, that they ſeem to the naked Eye to have none at all; but to crawl on their Bellies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Ground. Of all theſe three kinds, there are various ſorts wherewith God hath repleniſhed the Earth: And of every kind, ſome vaſtly great, and others very little; as
<hi>Abarbinel</hi> notes even among <pb n="25" facs="tcp:50230:19"/> 
                  <hi>Reptiles,</hi> there being <hi>Serpents</hi> of a prodigious length, and other creeping things far ſmaller than <hi>Ants.</hi>

               <p>Ver. 25. <hi>And God made,</hi> &amp;c.] The Earth did not bring them forth by Virtue of the Influence of Heaven, upon prepared Matter: But God framed them out of the Matter ſo prepared, and produced them in their full perfection, after their ſeveral kinds.</p>

Not to ſignifie any Deliberation within himſelf, or any Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in the Work; but to repreſent to us the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Man, and that he was made (as <hi>Abarbinel</hi> gloſſes) with admirable Wiſdom, and great Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.

Yet thus <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nilus</hi> fooliſhly expounded theſe words, as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> informs us, in the fore-named

That it is not to be underſtood, as if he askt their Advice, or was aſſiſted by their Judgment, but only that he uſed them as Inſtruments in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of every thing. Which is directly contrary to the very words, which are not in the form of a
<hi>Command,</hi> but of a <hi>Conſultation</hi> before Execution. Others therefore think God ſpeaks after the manner of Kings; who adviſe with their Council, but do things themſelves: And are wont to ſpeak in the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50230:20"/> Plural Number, when they declare their Pleaſure. But I take this to be a Cuſtom much later than the Days of <hi>Moſes;</hi> when they ſpake as the King of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> doth to <hi>Joſeph, Gen.</hi> XLI. 41, 44. <hi>I am Pharaoh;</hi> and <hi>ſee I have ſet thee</hi> (not

<hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliator,</hi> mentions one of their Doctors, who, in <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſchith Rabba,</hi> ſays, That when <hi>Moſes</hi> by God's Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection was about to write theſe words, <hi>Let us make Man,</hi> he cryed out, <hi>O Lord of the World, why wilt thou give Men occaſion to err, about thy moſt ſimple <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity?</hi> To which he received this anſwer, <hi>Write as I bid thee; and if any Man love to err, let him err.</hi> The ſame Story is told by
<hi>Joſeph Albo.</hi> Which ſhows that their Doctors have been long puzzled with this manner of Speech, which unavoidably ſuggeſted to their Thoughts, more than One Perſon in the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Which till they believe, they are at a loſs what to ſay about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In our Image, after our likeneſs.</hi>] Two words (ſome think) to expreſs the ſame thing: With this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence only, as
<hi>Abarbinel</hi> explains it, That the laſt words, <hi>after our likeneſs,</hi> give us to underſtand that Man was not created properly and perfectly in the Image of God; but in a reſemblance of him. For he doth not ſay, <hi>in our likeneſs</hi> (ſays that Author,) as he had ſaid <hi>in our Image,</hi> but <hi>after</hi> our likeneſs: <pb n="28" facs="tcp:50230:21"/> where the <hi>Caph</hi> of ſimilitude (as they call it) abates ſomething of the Sence of what follows; and makes it ſignifie only an approach to the Divine Likeneſs, in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, freedom of Choice, Spirituality, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality,</hi> &amp;c.

<hi>Coloſſ.</hi> III. 10. For the new Man conſiſts <hi>in righteouſneſs, and true holineſs,</hi> Epheſ. IV. 24. But though he was created with a Faculty to judge aright, and with a Power to govern his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, which he could controul more eaſily than we can do now; yet he was not made immutably good, (<hi>quia hoc Soli Deo cedit,</hi> which belongs to God alone, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> excellently diſcourſes in that place,) but might, without due care, be induced to do evil, as we ſee he did. For an habituated, confirmed eſtate of Goodneſs, was even then to have been acquired by Watchfulneſs and Exerciſe: Whereby in proceſs of time, he might have become ſo ſtedfaſt, that he could not have been prevailed upon by any Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to do contrary to his Duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And let them have dominion,</hi> &amp;c.] Some have thought the <hi>Image of God</hi> conſiſted in this alone. (See <hi>Greg. Nyſſen,</hi> cap. 4. <hi>De Opific. Hom.</hi> p. 143.). Which rather follows upon Man's being made in God's Image, <hi>viz.</hi> An intelligent being; which gave him <pb n="29" facs="tcp:50230:21"/> Dominion over other things, that are not indued with ſuch Underſtanding. I conclude this Note with a very pertinent Obſervation of his in that Book, <hi>cap.</hi> 16. That

No doubt God made Man juſt as he deſigned, in ſuch a compleat reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of himſelf, that there is no Creature like to Man, no more than God hath any equal to himſelf: As ſome of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors explain this Matter. And therefore
<hi>Moſes</hi> repeats it again, <hi>In the Image of God created he him:</hi> To imprint upon the Minds of Men, a Senſe of the great Dignity of Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; which was foully debaſed by worſhipping any Creature.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:50230:22"/>
                  <hi>Male and Female created he them.</hi>] He made <hi>Woman</hi> the ſame Day he made <hi>Man;</hi> as he did both Sexes of all other living Creatures, and as he made Herbs and Plants with Seed in them to propagate their Species, on the ſame Day they were produced. It is plain by this alſo, That <hi>Woman</hi> as well as <hi>Man</hi> was made in the Image of God. And it ſeems to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently obſerved by
<hi>Abarbinel,</hi> That <hi>Moſes</hi> here again uſes the word
<hi>Create,</hi> (and that three times) to denote the Original of Humane Souls; which are not <hi>made</hi> out of pre-exiſtent Matter, as our Bodies are; but by the Power of God, when they had no Being at all.</p>
               <p>Ver. 28. <hi>And God bleſſed them,</hi> &amp;c.] The former part of this Bleſſing, <hi>be fruitful and multiply,</hi> God had beſtowed before (<hi>verſe</hi> 22.) upon other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: Unto which he adds two things here, <hi>repleniſh the Earth and ſubdue it.</hi> He gives them the whole Earth for their Poſſeſſion, with a Power to <hi>ſubdue it:</hi> That is, to make it fit for their Habitation, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under, or driving away wild Beaſts. For, <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> he gives them the Dominion (unto which he deſigned them in their Creation) over all other Creatures; whether in the Water, Air, or Earth. And he ſpeaks to them in the Plural Number; which is a demonſtration, that <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Woman</hi> were both created, and received his Bleſſing, on the ſame Day.</p>
               <p>Ver. 29. <hi>Behold, I have given you,</hi> &amp;c.] Here he aſſigns them their Food; and makes no mention at all of Beaſts, but only of Plants and Fruits of the Earth. For Beaſts being made by pairs, in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Species, (we may well ſuppoſe) as Man and Woman were, and not being yet multiplied; the killing of Beaſts, Birds, and Fiſhes, would have been <pb n="31" facs="tcp:50230:22"/> the deſtruction of the kind: Whereas there were Plants innumerable, and great variety of Fruit for their ſuſtenance. And therefore here being no grant made to them of Animals for their Food, though no prohibition neither, it is very probable they abſtained from eating Fleſh, till after the Flood, (when God expreſly gave them every living thing for Meat, as much as the Herbs, IX. 2.) unleſs it were upon ſome ſpecial occaſions: As, perhaps, when they ſacrificed living Creatures; which they did in proceſs of time, (IV. 4) though not at the firſt.</p>
               <p>Ver. 30. <hi>And to every Beaſt,</hi> &amp;c.] Here he gives to the Beaſt, and Fowl, and Creeping things, all <hi>Herbs</hi> for their Food, but ſaith nothing of <hi>Fruit;</hi> from which we cannot well think the Birds would abſtain: And therefore they are included in the Phraſe,
<hi>of every green Herb.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 31. <hi>Very good.</hi>] From theſe words
<hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> confutes the <hi>Manichees, Haereſ.</hi> LXVI.
<hi>n.</hi> 18. where there is an explanation of this Phraſe (<hi>God ſaw that it was good</hi>) throughout this whole <hi>Chapter.</hi> Where it being ſaid at the end of every Day's Work, <hi>God ſaw it was good;</hi> and particularly here on the Sixth Day, before he had quite ended the Work of it, he ſaith ſo of the formation of the Beaſts, <hi>ver.</hi> 25.
<hi>Abarbinel</hi> will have this to relate peculiarly to the Creation of Man and Woman. But the beginning of the <hi>Verſe</hi> plainly ſhows that he ſpeaks of <hi>every thing that he had made:</hi> And therefore their Doctors in <hi>Bereſchith Rabba</hi> (whom he mentions) ſay a great deal better, That Man is meant in the firſt and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal place, when <hi>Moſes</hi> ſays, <hi>God ſaw every thing that he had made; and behold, it was very good.</hi>

               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>And God bleſſed the ſeventh Day, and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied it.</hi>] As God ſanctified <hi>Jeremiah</hi> in after-times
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:50230:23"/> from his Mother's Womb, (<hi>Jer.</hi> I. 5.) by ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to be a Prophet: So he now determined and appointed the Seventh Day, from the very beginning of the World, to be obſerved in Memory of its Creation.

               <p>There is no mention, indeed, made of <hi>Adam</hi>'s, or

<hi>Month,</hi> not of the Seventh Day of the <hi>Week;</hi> yet we may look upon that as a Remain of this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Tradition. Which, in time, Men forgot, as they did the moſt Natural Duties; having ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted their ways, (as we read <hi>Gen.</hi> VI. 10, 11.) that there was nothing good among the generality of them. And therefore no wonder if they did not regard the Service of God, every <hi>Seventh</hi> Day: To which I ſhall ſhow in due place,
<hi>Noah,</hi> the only righteous Man among them, had ſome regard. Which continued in the Family of <hi>Abraham</hi> after the Flood: <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaking of it, not long after their coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> (where it is likely they were not ſuffered to obſerve it, having no time free from their intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Labours,) as a Day known to them before the giving of the Law at Mount <hi>Sinai, Exod.</hi> XVI. 23, 25, 26.</p>
               <p>Which is not to be underſtood, as if the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> before and after the Flood, kept ſuch a Reſt, as God enjoyned the
<hi>Iſraelites</hi> by <hi>Moſes:</hi> For that was proper to them, for a peculiar reaſon; becauſe they had been Slaves in <hi>Egypt;</hi> and therefore were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to keep the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> without doing <hi>any manner of work</hi> upon that Day, <hi>Deut.</hi> V. 15.

               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>And every Plant in the Field, before it was in the Earth,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, before there was any Seed to produce them, God made them to ſpring up, with their Seed in them; as was ſaid before, in the firſt <hi>Chapter.</hi> And <hi>Moſes</hi> here mentions theſe alone, becauſe they were the firſt Productions out of the Earth; without which there had been no Food for living Creatures.</p>

                  <hi>For the LORD God had not cauſed it to rain on the Earth, and there was not a Man to till the Ground.</hi>] Here are two reaſons to confirm, that Plants were not produced, in the way they are now: For there had been no ſhowers of Rain; nor was there any Man to prepare the Earth to receive the Seed, (if there had been any) both which are neceſſary in the ordinary Method of Divine Providence, ever ſince the World was made.

               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.</hi>] So cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, as I take it, becauſe God intended by this Tree to prove <hi>Adam</hi> and
<hi>Eve,</hi> whether they would be good or bad: Which was to be made known, by their abſtaining from its Fruit, or eating of it. It is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally thought indeed by Interpreters, (of which I leave the Reader to judge,) that it had this Name afterward; either becauſe the Tempter pretended it would make them ſo wiſe, as to know all things, (for ſo <hi>good and evil</hi> may be expounded, (III. 5.) to ſignifie as much as <hi>all things whatſoever,</hi>) or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, in the event, upon the eating of this Fruit, they did actually know by miſerable experience, (which they would not learn without it,) the great difference between obeying, and diſobeying God's Commands. That is, they who did not ſufficiently attend to their Duty, nor conſider what it was to Sin, and what the effect of it would be; preſently, upon the eating of this Fruit, reflected upon both. For they ſaw how grievous it was to incurr God's Diſpleaſure, by believing a Creature rather than Him, and by being ſo ungrateful as not to acknowledge his Bounty in all the Bleſſings they enjoyed; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thinking Him envious in denying them one, as a proof of their Obedience.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:50230:28"/>Some think it was ſo called, as a
<hi>Caveat</hi> to them, not to ſtudy Craft and Subtilty; but to content themſelves in a ſimple plain way of life, (wherein God made them,) without any Curioſity to know more than was needful for them. Which they think is confirmed by III. 6. <hi>She ſaw it was good to make one wiſe;</hi> i. e. cunning and wily.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>And a River went out of Eden,</hi> &amp;c.] Theſe words afford us ſuch a Key to open to us the Place where this Garden was planted, that one can ſcarce doubt whereabout it was; though the preciſe ſpot of Ground be not marked out in this deſcription of it. For it lay in the Country of <hi>Eden;</hi> and we are directed to find that out by this remarkable Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, That <hi>a River went out of it.</hi> Which doth not ſignifie that the Spring of the River was in <hi>Eden;</hi> but that the River run through that Country into the Garden, <hi>to water it.</hi> The Garden therefore, it is probable, was a part of the Province of <hi>Eden;</hi> and was water'd by that River which came from it. The only difficulty is to find what River this was. Our Country man Mr. <hi>Canver,</hi> in his learned Diſcourſe of the <hi>Terreſtrial Paradiſe, chap.</hi> VII. endeavours to prove, that the two great Rivers, <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and <hi>Tigris,</hi> having but one and the ſame Fountain in <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia,</hi> the greater, run along for ſome time in one Stream called <hi>Tigris:</hi> Upon which he thinks this Garden was ſeated, before this River parted into two Streams,
<hi>Euphrates</hi> and <hi>Tigris.</hi> This he confirms, out of the two Epiſtles of the <hi>Neſtorian</hi> Chriſtians, written to <hi>Rome</hi>
1552, and tranſlated by <hi>Maſius;</hi> where they call <hi>Tigris</hi> the River of <hi>Eden.</hi> And there are indeed ſome ancient Authors, particularly <hi>Lucan,</hi> and <hi>Boetius,</hi> who ſay that theſe two Rivers come out <pb n="43" facs="tcp:50230:28"/> of the ſame Spring: But their miſtake aroſe, its like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from hence, That they ſprung (as <hi>Strabo</hi> tells us) out of one and the ſame Mountain, <hi>viz. Niphates,</hi> which is a part of <hi>Taurus:</hi> And <hi>Euphrates</hi> ſprung out of the Northern ſide of it, and <hi>Tigris</hi> out of the Southern; as <hi>Salmaſius</hi> obſerves upon <hi>Solinus,</hi> p. 621, &amp;c. Certain it is, that the beſt Authors; both Ancient and Modern, make them to have different Springs, from whence they hold different Courſes, <hi>Euphrates</hi> toward the
<hi>Weſt,</hi> and <hi>Tigris</hi> toward the <hi>Eaſt:</hi> And do not make one River, till (after they have run through many Countries) they meet and joyn together about <hi>Apamia,</hi> according to <hi>Ptolomy.</hi> And then indeed they make for a long way, but one great Stream: Which I take to be the
<hi>River</hi> here mentioned by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and run through the Country of <hi>Eden,</hi> which perhaps lay on both ſides of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; as the Garden it is plain by <hi>verſe</hi> 8. did on the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> ſide of it; extending it ſelf to the place, where theſe united Rivers parted again. For ſo it follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And from thence.</hi>] <hi>i. e.</hi> Below the Garden.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It parted.</hi>] Or, was divided again, as it had been before into two other Streams. By which words we ſeem to have found the Place where the Garden end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but being not told where it began, nor how far it ſpread it ſelf <hi>Eaſtward</hi> from the River ſide, I will not preſume to ſay what Country or Countries it included. Certain it is there was a Country, as I obſerved before, called <hi>Eden</hi> in after times, which was part of the Kingdom of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> XIX.
12. And that Kingdom then comprehended not only the Country anciently called
<hi>Aſhur,</hi> but <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> and <hi>Babylonia,</hi> &amp;c. In ſome part of <pb n="44" facs="tcp:50230:29"/> which laſt Province it is probable this Garden was ſeated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And became into four Heads.</hi>] He doth not ſay <hi>was parted</hi> into four Heads, but <hi>became into</hi> four Heads, (whoſe Names here follow,) two before they united, <hi>viz. Tigris,</hi> and
<hi>Euphrates;</hi> and two after they again parted, <hi>viz. Piſon,</hi> and
<hi>Gihon.</hi> Theſe he calls <hi>Heads,</hi> or Principal Rivers, as
<hi>David Chytraeus,</hi> I think, rightly underſtands it, <hi>quatuor illuſtria &amp; magna flumina efficiebant,</hi> made four famous and great Rivers. For all Diviſions from the main Stream are called the <hi>Heads</hi> of a Water; as Sir <hi>W. Raleigh</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves out of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lpianus.</hi> And it is indifferent whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Water come out of a Fountain, or out of a River, or a Lake: For that part of the River (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) where the Branch forſakes the main Stream, is called the <hi>Head</hi> of that Branch; which becomes a new River. In like manner may <hi>Euphrates</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gris</hi> be called the <hi>Heads</hi> of that River which they made at their meeting: As where they part again, the <hi>beginnings</hi> (as the LXX tranſlate the word) of the other two Rivers, <hi>Piſon</hi> and <hi>Gihon,</hi> are properly called the <hi>Heads</hi> of them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>The name of the firſt is Piſon,</hi> or
<hi>Phiſon.</hi>] This is that Branch which runs <hi>Weſterly;</hi> and being neareſt to the place where <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote, on the other ſide of <hi>Jordan,</hi> is firſt mentioned by him. It is a long time ſince both this River and <hi>Gihon</hi> have loſt theſe Names: The <hi>Greek</hi> and
<hi>Roman</hi> Writers cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them ſtill, after their parting, by the Names they had before they met, <hi>Euphrates</hi> and <hi>Tigris.</hi> But there was a remainder of the Name of <hi>Piſon</hi> preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the

2.) including, as it were, in its Womb, all the Natural Laws of God. For, as in obſerving this Law he had teſtified his unſpotted Love and Obedience to God; ſo in violating it, he threw off the Divine Government, and oppoſed his own Will to God's. But ſtill ſome ask, Why ſhould his Obedience be tried, in ſuch an Inſtance as this? Not conſidering that an Experiment of it, could ſcarce have been made in any of the Moral Precepts: Which there was no occaſion to violate. For what ſhould tempt him to Idolatry, or to take God's Name in vain, or to murder his Wife? How was it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to commit Adultery, when there was no Body but he and ſhe in the World? How could he Steal, or what room was there then for Coveting, when God <pb n="51" facs="tcp:50230:32"/> had put him in poſſeſſion of all things? It had been in vain to forbid that, which could not be done; and it had not been Vertue to abſtain from that to which there was no Temptation; but from that which invited them to Tranſgreſs.

<hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors inferr all mixture with Beaſts to be contrary to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; who are neither one Fleſh with us, nor one with another. For in this our Bodies, as well as our Souls, have a preheminence above theirs; which were not made one Fleſh after ſuch a manner as Man and Woman were.

               <p>Now this following immediately after the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the formation of <hi>Eve,</hi> hath made ſome fanſie, that our firſt Parents fell the very ſame day they were made. And thus much, I think, muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, That they did not continue very long in their happy ſtate: For, if they had perſiſted ſtedfaſtly in their Duty, for a conſiderable time; they would have acquired ſuch an habit of well-doing, as would not have been ſo eaſily loſt. But that they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued longer than a Day, there are many Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances to induce us to believe. For it required ſome time for <hi>Adam</hi> to be acquainted with all other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and to impoſe Names upon them: And there <pb n="59" facs="tcp:50230:36"/> being none of them a meet help for him, he ſlept ſome time, till <hi>Eve</hi> had taken her Beginning out of him. Whom, when he ſaw, he received, and own'd her for his Wife; and no doubt made more Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon God's Wiſdom, Power, and Goodneſs, than are ſet down in this Sacred Story. They both alſo received a Command from God, not to eat of one Tree in the Garden: Into which, when they were brought, we cannot but think they walk'd about it, and took ſuch a view of it, as to be convinced, by the bountiful Proviſion God had made for them, they had no reaſon to complain of the ſmall Reſtraint he laid upon them. All which could not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed ſo ſpeedily as ſome have imagined; for though God can do what he pleaſes in an inſtant, yet Man cannot; and God himſelf did not in one Day create the World. And, beſides, that ſome time was neceſſary for tranſacting all theſe things; it is not likely the Devil would immediately ſet upon <hi>Eve,</hi> as ſoon as the Command was laid upon them; but rather let it be a little forgotten. And if the time be obſerved when he aſſaulted her, it will much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm this Opinion, which was in the abſence of her Husband; for that we cannot eaſily believe to have been upon the ſame Day they were created. The extraordinary Kindneſs they had one for the other, will ſcarce allow us to think it poſſible, they ſhould be ſo ſoon ſeparated. It is plain alſo, God
<hi>ſanctified the Seventh Day</hi> before their fall: Which it is highly probable they ſpent in admiring and praiſing the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Goodneſs.</p>

<hi>p.</hi> 291, &amp;c. But I take the conjecture of another very learned Perſon, now a Biſhop of our Church, to be far more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: Which I ſhall endeavour to ſtrengthen. There were (and ſtill are in the
<hi>Eaſtern</hi> and <hi>Southern</hi> Parts of the World,) Serpents having Wings, and ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning very brightly, like to Fire. So we read, <hi>Iſai.</hi> XIV. 29. of <hi>a flying fiery Serpent.</hi> Which <hi>fiery Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents</hi> are called <hi>Seraphims,</hi> in <hi>Numb.</hi> XXI. 6, 8. and termed
<hi>fiery,</hi> not merely with reſpect to their Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom, which made ſore Inflammations in the Bodies of thoſe who were bitten by them; but becauſe they appeared ſhining like Fire, when they flew in the Air.</p>
               <p>Whence <hi>Seraphim</hi> is the Name alſo of the higheſt ſort of Angels, (called the <hi>Angels of the Preſence,</hi>)
<hi>Iſai.</hi> VI. 2, 6. Who appeared, I ſuppoſe, in ſome ſuch form with flaming Wings. For otherwiſe, I cannot think <hi>Serpents</hi> would have been honoured as Sacred things in ſo many Countries, as we find they anciently were; unleſs they had been the Symbols of <pb n="61" facs="tcp:50230:37"/>
                  <hi>Angels.</hi> The Devil therefore, I conceive, made uſe of ſome ſuch Serpent, (but of a more ſurpaſſing brightneſs, than any now extant,) that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble one of the moſt illuſtrious Angels, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſometimes in the like ſhape. Which moved <hi>Eve</hi> the more readily to hearken unto the Voice of the Serpent; taking it to be one of the heavenly
<hi>Seraphims,</hi> which ſhe had ſeen ſometime, in ſuch a ſplendid form, attend upon the Divine Glory, or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty: For the Angels always made a part of the <hi>SCHECHINAH.</hi> And thus, one would think, <hi>Tertullian</hi> underſtood this matter, when he ſaid in his Book <hi>De Praeſcript. Haeret. C.</hi> XLVII. <hi>Iſtum fuiſſe Serpentem, cui Eva, ut filio Dei crediderat,</hi> this was the Serpent, to whom <hi>Eve</hi> gave Credit, as to the Son of God. Which if any one take to be the words of the Hereticks he is there ſpeaking of; yet thoſe are not, which we find in his Book againſt the <hi>Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, cap.</hi> II. where he ſaith the Serpent was <hi>a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mordio Divinae imaginis praedo,</hi> an Uſurper of the Divine Image from the beginning. See Dr. <hi>Teniſon</hi> of <hi>Idolatry, p.</hi> 356. To which that paſſage in <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi> may be added, who mentions ſome Hereticks (who might have ſome Truth among them) that ſaid, the Woman liſtned to the Serpent, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<hi>Verſe</hi> of this <hi>Chapter,</hi>) <hi>this is the Secret</hi> (or
<hi>Myſtery</hi>) of the Holy Language, <hi>that a Serpent is called</hi> SARAPH, <hi>as an Angel is called</hi> SARAPH. For which he quotes the fore-named place, <hi>Numb.</hi> XXI. 6. and then adds, The Scripture calls Serpents <hi>Seraphim,</hi> becauſe they <pb n="62" facs="tcp:50230:38"/> were
<hi>Toledoth hanacaſh hakadmoni,</hi> the offspring of this old Serpent:
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand this,</hi> (ſo he concludes, as our Saviour ſpeaks in another Caſe, <hi>whoſo readeth, let him underſtand,</hi>) as a Matter of great concernment. Which can have no other meaning, I think, but this; That the Devil (whom St. <hi>John</hi> alſo calls the <hi>old Serpent, Revel.</hi> XII. 9.) in this Serpent here ſpoken of, counterfeited a Glorious
<hi>Seraphim,</hi> and thereby ſeduced <hi>Eve</hi> to give Credit to him.</p>
               <p>However this be, it is moſt reaſonable to ſuppoſe, it was ſome beautiful Creature; by whom <hi>Eve</hi> thought an Angel, who wiſh'd them well, diſcourſed with her: For ſhe was not ſo ſimple as to think that Beaſts could ſpeak; much leſs, that they knew more of God's Mind than her ſelf. Nor doth it ſeem at all credible to me, that ſhe could have been other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways deceived, but by ſome Creature which appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſo gloriouſly, that ſhe took it for an heavenly Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter; who, ſhe thought, came to explain to them the meaning of the Divine Command.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yea, hath God ſaid.</hi>] This doth not look like the beginning of a Diſcourſe, but the concluſion: As the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves have obſerved. And, it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, that the Tempter, before he ſpake theſe words, repreſented himſelf as one of the heavenly Court; who came, or was ſent, to congratulate the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs that God had beſtowed upon them in <hi>Paradiſe:</hi> Which was ſo great, that he could not eaſily believe he had denied them any of the Fruit of the Garden. He deſired therefore to be ſatisfied from her own Mouth, of the Truth of what he pretended to have heard; or to know how they underſtood the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God. For ſo theſe words may be tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>Is it true indeed, hath God ſaid, Ye ſhall not eat <pb n="63" facs="tcp:50230:38"/> of every Tree,</hi> &amp;c. Which is a very ancient Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, and more probable than theirs, who would have the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Particles, <hi>aph ki,</hi> ſignifie as much as <hi>ut ut: Although God hath ſaid, ye ſhall not eat, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ye ſhall not die.</hi> So they ſuppoſe he was going to add, but before he had ſpoken the latter part of the Sentence, <hi>Eve</hi> interrupted him ſaying, <hi>We may eat of the Fruit of the Trees of the Garden.</hi> This had been too groſs, flatly to contradict what God had ſaid: Whereas the beginning of the <hi>Verſe</hi> tells us, he went more
<hi>ſubtilly</hi> to work.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>And the Woman ſaid unto the Serpent, We may eat of the Fruit of the Trees of the Garden.</hi>] She ſeems to have underſtood him, as if he thought God had forbid them to eat of any Fruit in the Garden. And indeed the foregoing Queſtion is ambiguous; like thoſe Oracles of his which made him be called <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, (oblique or crooked) by the ancient Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then; becauſe they had two meanings. She truly therefore reports the Sence of God's Prohibition, in this and the following <hi>Verſe.</hi> Though there are thoſe who think, ſhe pronounced theſe words, <hi>We may eat of the Fruit,</hi> &amp;c. with ſome admiration, that they ſhould be reſtrained from one Fruit, when God had moſt liberally granted them all the reſt. The reaſon of which ſhe did not know, and ſhowed her deſire perhaps to underſtand it.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>But of the Fruit of the Tree, which is in the midſt of the Garden, God hath ſaid, ye ſhall not eat of it, nor touch it, leſt ye die.</hi>] Some fanſie the Woman here began to prevaricate in
<hi>two</hi> things: <hi>Firſt,</hi> In ſaying they might not <hi>touch it: Secondly,</hi> In ſaying only there was danger, if they meddled with it, and not an abſolute threatning. Of which the Devil, <pb n="64" facs="tcp:50230:39"/> they think, took advantage; and immediately aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured her, there was no danger at all. This laſt they ground upon the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Particle <hi>pen,</hi> which we tranſlate <hi>leſt,</hi> and expreſſes a doubting. But I do not think either of theſe Obſervations are ſolid: For that Particle doth not always imply a Doubt, as we may learn from the Second <hi>Pſalm,</hi> the laſt <hi>Verſe,</hi> and many other places: And the <hi>touching</hi> of the Fruit, ſignifies the plucking it off from the Tree, in order to eat it: Which was expreſly forbidden.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>Ye ſhall not ſurely die.</hi>] You are under a miſtake: Death will not be the certain Conſequence of your eating this Fruit. For God is too Good to inflict ſuch an heavy Puniſhment, for ſo ſmall a Fault.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>For God,</hi> &amp;c.] The Particle <hi>ki,</hi> which we tranſlate <hi>for,</hi> ſignifies here as much as <hi>but,</hi> (as <hi>Abarbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel</hi> and others obſerve,) juſt as in <hi>Pſalm</hi> CXV. 1. So the meaning is, you ſhall be in no danger, but quite contrary, be great gainers by taſting of this Fruit: As God himſelf knows, who only keeps you in Awe by his Threatning, but will not be ſo ſevere as to execute it; when he ſees you much improved, not impaired by eating it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then your Eyes ſhall be opened.</hi>] For you will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately diſcover abundance of things, whereof you are now ignorant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ye ſhall be as Gods.</hi>] Like unto us, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of God: Who are frequently called <hi>Elohim, i. e.</hi> Gods, in Scripture. Thus <hi>Maimonides</hi> underſtands it. <hi>More Nevoch. Pars</hi> I.

<hi>enjoy freely what you pleaſe.</hi> For to <hi>know</hi> is ſometimes as much as to <hi>enjoy,</hi> in the Scripture-Language: So that according to this Interpretation, he promiſes them likeneſs to God himſelf; who is abſolutely free, and ſubject to none.</p>
               <p>But in this ſuggeſtion the Devil proved, what our Saviour ſays of him, That he was <hi>a Lyar from the beginning:</hi> For there are no leſs than <hi>four</hi> Lyes (as ſome reckon them) in theſe two
<hi>Verſes.</hi> Which makes it ſeem ſtrange that <hi>Eve</hi> ſhould give Credit to theſe Suggeſtions, which were very fooliſh: It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incredible that God ſhould envy them any thing, who had given them their Beings, and innumerable Bleſſings. I can give no account of it, but this: That when we are ſearching after the Reaſon of things (as ſhe, I ſuppoſe, was of this Prohibition) and cannot find it; if one be ſuggeſted to us, which never came into our Mind before, though in it ſelf unlikely, we are ready to catch at it, and to be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with it. For when the Mind is weary with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring, it is ſatisfied with a falſe Reaſon, rather than have none. The promiſe alſo of Knowledge was very tempting; eſpecially of ſuch Knowledge as he gave her hope would raiſe and advance her, to a more noble Condition. And it is likely ſhe thought an heavenly Miniſter (as ſhe took him to be) might underſtand God's meaning better than her ſelf.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>And when the Woman ſaw the Tree was good,</hi> &amp;c.] This <hi>Verſe</hi> gives a further account of that which ſeems very ſtrange, the Diſobedience of our <pb n="66" facs="tcp:50230:40"/> firſt Parents. She look'd ſo long upon the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Fruit, till ſhe not only had an Appetite to it, as <hi>excellent Food,</hi> but was taken with its
<hi>beautiful</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; and was alſo ſtrongly poſſeſſed, by the perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the old Serpent, that her Mind would be no leſs pleaſed than her Palate, by an increaſe in Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Wiſdom. Theſe were powerful Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, (expreſſed in theſe words, <hi>good for Food, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to the Eyes, and to be deſired to make one Wiſe,</hi>) and ſhe could ſee no Evil in the thing it ſelf; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the mere Pleaſure of God, of which ſhe did not apprehend the Reaſon, that made the eating of it a Crime. This Fruit alſo was planted, not in an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure place, but
<hi>in the midſt of the Garden,</hi> (<hi>Verſe</hi> 3.) near to the Tree of Life: Which made it the more inviting; by its being always in her Eye, as well as very beautiful; and raiſed, perhaps, the greater won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in her, that God ſhould forbid a thing, which he had made ſo eminent for its Beauty. Hereupon ſhe yielded, and (as it follows) <hi>took of the Fruit thereof and did eat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And gave unto her Husband with her.</hi>] Who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to her, it is likely, as ſhe was eating the Fruit; and was ſoon perſuaded to bear her company; for it immediately follows, <hi>and he did eat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a queſtion whether he debated the Matter with her, till he was ſatisfied with the Arguments that moved her to eat; or, his great Affection to her drew him in, to do as ſhe did: Without any other Conſideration, perhaps, than this; That he choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to die, than out-live one, whom he loved moſt paſſionately. To this laſt, the Apoſtle's words ſeem to incline, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> II. 14. <hi>Adam was not deceived:</hi> Though they do not neceſſarily ſignifie, it muſt be

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Weſt Wind was wont to blow towards the cloſe of the Day. Which being a ſoft and gentle Gale, the Sound they heard was the more aſtoniſhing, which ſeemed to threaten a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Storm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Onkelos</hi> thus paraphraſes the firſt words, <hi>they heard the Voice of the WORD of the LORD:</hi> That is, of the Son of God; who appeared in <hi>very glorious Clouds;</hi> or, rather, <hi>in flaming Fire,</hi> of ſuch an ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Brightneſs, that they were not able to endure the ſight of it. For ſo it follows:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adam and his Wife hid themſelves from the preſence of the LORD God,</hi> &amp;c.] It's plain by this there was the appearance of an extraordinary Preſence: Which affrighted them, and made them run <hi>among the Trees of the Garden,</hi> i. e. into the Thickets, or the cloſeſt places they could find there.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:50230:41"/>I cannot but think the <hi>SCHECHINAH,</hi> or <hi>Divine Majeſty,</hi> appeared quite otherwiſe than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly: That is, not in ſo mild a Luſtre as when they were firſt acquainted with him; but in a more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riole burning Light, as if it would conſume them. For ſo we read in after-times, that the ſame LORD who appeared unto <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>a flame of Fire</hi> out of the midſt of a Buſh, (<hi>Ex.</hi> III.
2.) came down in a more dreadful manner, at the giving of the Law, from Mount

               </p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>And the LORD God called unto Adam.</hi>] As he did to <hi>Moſes</hi> out of the Buſh, <hi>Exod.</hi> III. 4. and to

               <p>
                  <hi>And ſaid unto him.</hi>] With a Majeſtick Voice, againſt which he could not ſtop his Ears.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Where art thou?</hi>] Why doſt thou run into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, like the wild Beaſts? Such Queſtions do not argue Ignorance in him that asks them; but are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to awaken the Guilty to a confeſſion of their Crimes. As appears from IV. 10. <hi>Where is Abel thy Brother?</hi> Of whom
<hi>Cain</hi> ſtubbornly refuſing to give an account, the LORD ſaid immediately, (to ſhow he needed not to be informed,) <hi>the Voice of thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Blood crieth unto me, from the Ground.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>And he ſaid, I heard thy Voice, and I was afraid, becauſe I was naked,</hi> &amp;c.] The very Sound of the approach of thy Preſence, ſo affrighted me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I found I had loſt my Innocency, that I hid my ſelf from thee. This was a fooliſh and vain attempt;
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:50230:42"/> but as Guilt makes Men fearful, ſo that bereaves them of all Conſideration.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>And he ſaid, Who told thee that thou waſt naked?</hi>] Diveſted of thoſe noble Endowments, which I beſtowed on thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Haſt thou eaten,</hi> &amp;c.] Tranſgreſſed my Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>And the Man ſaid, The Woman whom thou gaveſt,</hi> &amp;c.] I confeſs my Guilt; into which I was drawn by her, whom thou gaveſt me for an help. Thus we are apt to excuſe and palliate our Faults; by laying that Load upon others, with which we ought to charge our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>And the LORD God ſaid unto the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> &amp;c.] What moved thee to violate my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſhe ſaid, The Serpent beguiled me.</hi>] My Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was deceived, by the Cunning of the Devil. Thus ſhe alſo threw the blame upon another. But God, no doubt, convinced them both, of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Guilt, and the miſerable Condition into which they were faln by their Tranſgreſſion; before he ended this Diſcourſe with them. Which ſhows the Infinite Mercy of the Creator of all, who would not abandon them; but ſought after them, to ſave them, when they had loſt themſelves.</p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>And the LORD ſaid unto the Serpent, Thou art curſed,</hi> &amp;c.] It is obſerved by <hi>Tertullian,</hi> That though God inflicted Puniſhments on <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> yet he did not
<hi>curſe</hi> them, as he did the Serpent, <hi>ut reſtitutionis candidatos,</hi> they ſtanding fair for a Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution to his Favour,
<hi>L.</hi> II. <hi>adv. Marcion. c.</hi> 25. And I may add, God did not begin with them; but firſt Sentences the Serpent, before he proceeds to Judgment
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:50230:42"/> upon them: Which denotes that he (the old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent) was the great Offender, being the firſt Mover to Sin; which made his Crime more grievous than theirs.</p>
               <p>Now, to be <hi>curſed,</hi> is to be deprived of what was before enjoyed, and doomed to a miſerable wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Condition of life: The particulars of which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. The only difficulty is, Why the <hi>Serpent</hi> (lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſo called) ſhould be curſed, as it manifeſtly is, (though the Devil alſo, I ſhall ſhow is intended) being but an Inſtrument which the Evil Spirit uſed; and had neither Will to Sin, nor yet Underſtanding or Knowledge of what the Devil did? It is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly anſwered, That this is no more than the Curſe which God inflicted upon the Earth, (which was not capable of Sinning) for <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſake, <hi>verſe</hi> 17. But ſtill the Reaſon of that Curſe is enquired; which is evident enough: Man himſelf being puniſhed by the Curſe upon the Earth: Which did not yield its Fruit ſo plentifully and ſo eaſily, as it had done before his Tranſgreſſion. And the reaſon of this Curſe upon the
<hi>Serpent,</hi> may be the better diſcerned by another Inſtance which we find <hi>Exod.</hi> XXI. 28. where an Ox which gored a Man or a Woman, that they died, is ordered <hi>to be ſtoned, and his Fleſh not to be eaten.</hi> This ſure was to ſhow the great value God ſet upon Man's Life: Which he ſecured alſo by this Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which moved all Owners to look well to their Beaſts that might indanger it. Even ſo was the Serpent condemned, in Mercy to <hi>Adam</hi> and his Wife, (whom, it is manifeſt by what follows, God intended to reſtore into his Favour,) that they might be ever mindful of the foulneſs of their Guilt, and excited to Repentance; by ſeeing a noble Creature, (who <pb n="72" facs="tcp:50230:43"/> was but the Inſtrument of it,) ſo extreamly debaſed into a moſt vile Condition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon thy Belly ſhalt thou go.</hi>] This ſhows the
<hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent</hi> was a more noble Creature before this Fact: But changed after it, from a flying <hi>Seraph</hi> (as the word is <hi>Numb.</hi> XXI. 6.) into a foul creeping Serpent; not moving aloft in the Air, but crawling upon the Earth and licking the Duſt. So it follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And Duſt ſhalt thou eat, all the days of thy life.</hi>] There is no viler Food than this: Which doth not ſignifie the Serpent ſhould feed upon nothing elſe: But that creeping on the Ground it cannot but lick up much Duſt together with its Food, whatſoever that be.</p>
               <p>All this is literally the Curſe of the <hi>Serpent:</hi> But as the <hi>Devil</hi> lay hidden under the Covert of the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi> though he be not named; ſo <hi>his</hi> Curſe is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in this Curſe of the <hi>Serpent,</hi> though it be not ſeparately mentioned. As appears by the following <hi>Verſe,</hi> which hath a peculiar reſpect to the Devil, under the Name of the Serpent. And the Devil's Curſe in general was this; to be thruſt down further than before, from his ancient heavenly Habitation; and condemned to live in the lower ſmoaky Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Air: Where he hath loſt all relliſh of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Enjoyments, and pleaſes himſelf only in his vile endeavours to make Mankind as wicked as himſelf.</p>
               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>I will put enmity between thee and the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and between thy Seed and her Seed.</hi>] An irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilable Feud, throughout all Generations. Which is true of the Serpent, literally underſtood, between whom and Mankind there is ſuch an Antipathy, that it diſcovers it ſelf both in the <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>ſenſitive</hi> 
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:50230:43"/> Faculties of them both: Their Humours being Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to each other; and Man being aſtoniſhed at the ſight of a Serpent more than any other Creature; and the Serpent in like manner at the ſight of a Man, eſpecially (if Naturaliſts ſay true) of a <hi>naked</hi> Man. Thus Mr. <hi>Mede, Diſcourſe</hi> XXXIX. <hi>p.</hi> 295. But this is far more true and certain of the <hi>Spiritual Serpent,</hi> the Devil, and his Angels, (who joyned with him in his Apoſtaſie,) and the Woman and her Seed, in whom theſe words are more literally fulfilled. For <hi>Maimonides</hi> juſtly admires, that the Seed of the <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> ſhould be only mention'd, and not of <hi>Adam,</hi> (without whom <hi>ſhe</hi> could have no Seed; which therefore muſt be <hi>his</hi> Seed,) and that it ſhould be ſaid of
<hi>her</hi> Seed, not of <hi>his,</hi> that it bruiſed the Serpent's Head.
<hi>More Nevochim,</hi> P. II. cap. 30. <hi>This,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is one of the Paſſages in Scripture which is moſt won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, and not to be underſtood, according to the Letter; but contains great Wiſdom in it.</hi> In which Words he wrote more Truth than he was aware; but was not able to unfold this hidden Wiſdom, as we Chriſtians, bleſſed be God, are able to do. For this <hi>Seed</hi> here ſpoken of is Chriſt, as both the
<hi>Targums</hi> (that aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to <hi>Jonathan,</hi> and that called the
<hi>Hieruſalem</hi>) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it; and as we are taught to underſtand it, by God's Words to <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he renewed this Promiſe: <hi>In thy Seed</hi> (that is Chriſt, ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) <hi>ſhall all Nations be bleſſed,</hi> Gen. XXII. 18. Gal. III. 8, 16: For he vanquiſhed the Devil, who had now vanquiſhed Mankind. So it here follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It ſhall bruiſe thy Head.</hi>] i. e. <hi>That SEED</hi> of the Woman ſhall diſpoil thee of thy Power, (meaning the Devil,) and aboliſh thy Tyranny. For in the Head of the Serpent (to which there is here an allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) <pb n="74" facs="tcp:50230:44"/> lies his ſtrength: As
<hi>Epaminondas</hi> repreſented to the <hi>Thebans,</hi> when he exhorted them to ſet upon a Band of <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> by ſhowing them the Head of a vaſt Snake, which he had cruſhed, (<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,) ſaying, <hi>Look ye, the Body can do no hurt, now the Head is gone:</hi> Meaning, That if they routed the
<hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> the reſt of the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates would ſignifie nothing. <hi>Polyaen. L.</hi> II. <hi>Strateg.</hi> And therefore Mr.
<hi>Mede</hi> hath rightly interpreted the <hi>Serpent's Head,</hi> to ſignifie <hi>the Devil's Sovereignty,</hi> (<hi>Diſcourſe</hi> XXV.
<hi>p.</hi> 143. and XXXIX. <hi>p.</hi> 298.) and that Sovereignty, is the Power of Death: Which Headſhip of the Devil, the <hi>Seed of the Woman</hi> (that is <hi>Chriſt the Lord</hi>) hath broken in pieces, and at laſt will utterly deſtroy, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> XV. 25, 26.</p>
               <p>There is a notable Example of this Enmity, in the ſtruggle between Chriſt and the Devil for Empire, in <hi>Rev.</hi> XII. 7, 8. where Chriſt deſtroyed the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty of the Serpent in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire ſo ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually; that there was <hi>no more place found, for the Dragon and his Angels, in Heaven;</hi> i. e. The Devil utterly loſt his Sovereignty in that State; as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> interprets it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And thou ſhalt bruiſe his Heel.</hi>] This Victory over the Devil was not to be gotten without Blood: For the Devil did all that he was able to deſtroy <hi>this Seed.</hi> But that was impoſſible to be done; he could only aſſault his lower part, (called here the <hi>Heel,</hi>)
<hi>viz.</hi> His Body or Fleſh: Which, by his Inſtruments, he perſecuted, deſpitefully uſed, and at laſt crucified. By which very means (ſo admirable was the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Goodneſs of God) the <hi>Seed of the Woman</hi> conquered the Devil, as the Apoſtle ſhows, <hi>Heb.</hi> II.
14, 15. For it muſt be here noted, That Chriſt was <pb n="75" facs="tcp:50230:44"/> properly and literally the <hi>Seed of the Woman,</hi> and not at all of the Man: Being born, without him, of a pure Virgin. The tender Mercy of God alſo muſt here be acknowledged; which gave our firſt Parents hope of a recovery, as ſoon as they were faln: By making them this moſt gracious Promiſe. Which, though here ſomething obſcurely delivered, grew clearer and clearer, in every Age, till Chriſt came.</p>
               <p>It cannot be denied likewiſe, but that by <hi>Seed,</hi> may be underſtood (<hi>collectively</hi>) all the Faithful, who by the Power of their Lord, vanquiſh all the Power of their Spiritual Enemy. (See
<hi>Luke</hi> X. 19.) Yet ſo, that we muſt confeſs, there was <hi>one Eminent Seed</hi> here Primarily intended, by whom they overcome. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom another <hi>Seed</hi> is not here oppoſed in this laſt part of the
<hi>Verſe,</hi> (as in the former part,) but the Serpent himſelf: Which points at a ſingle Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate (as I may call it) between this promiſed
<hi>Seed</hi> and the Devil. But if we will take in the other Sence alſo, underſtanding by <hi>Seed,</hi> Chriſt with all his Members, then the
<hi>bruiſing their Heel</hi> ſignifies, (as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> expounds it,) the Devil's deceit and guile in aſſaulting us unawares: As they do who
<hi>come behind</hi> others, when they do not obſerve them, and catch hold of their Heel. For that this is an Emblem of guile and deceitful dealing, appears from the Story of <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob;</hi> the latter of which had his Name from catching his Brother by the Heel at his Birth, which
<hi>Eſau</hi> took for an indication of his <hi>beguiling him,</hi> as he did two times. See <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> XXXVII. <hi>p.</hi> 184.</p>
               <p>It is fit, I think, here to note further, (what the learned Mr.
<hi>Alix</hi> hath obſerved,) That God in this Promiſe did a particular Kindneſs to our Father <pb n="76" facs="tcp:50230:45"/> 
                  <hi>Adam.</hi> Who having been ſeduced by his Wife to eat the forbidden Fruit, it might have occaſioned a Breach between them; had not God taken Care to prevent it, by making this gracious Promiſe of a Redeemer, to depend upon his Union with his Wife: From whom, he aſſures them, one ſhould deſcend, that ſhould repair their Loſſes.</p>
               <p>The time likewiſe when this Promiſe was made is remarkable: Which was, before God had rejected <hi>Cain</hi> and preferred <hi>Seth</hi> to him; and long before any reſtriction made to <hi>Noah</hi>'s Family, or
<hi>Sem</hi>'s, (who derived from him,) that all the World might look upon the
<hi>MESSIAH</hi> as a common Benefit to all the Sons of <hi>Adam.</hi>

Whence it is, that he, who had only ſinned himſelf, and not cauſed others to ſin, had his Judgment laſt of all.

<hi>Leaves of Trees,</hi> which they made themſelves; being ready at hand, woven by Divine Art. The next were of the <hi>Skins of Beaſts;</hi> which were much warmer, and better able to defend them from the injury of Cold and Weather: And theſe were made by God's Direction. Who having made a moſt gracious Covenant with our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, (<hi>verſe</hi> 15.) it ſeems not unreaſonable to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that he alſo ſignified to them, they ſhould, for the confirmation of it, offer to him Sacrifices: By the Blood of which, Covenants were ratified in after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, from this Example. For it is not likely, that the Beaſts, of whoſe Skins theſe Coats were made, died of themſelves; or, that they were killed mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for this uſe, or for their Food. And therefore what is ſo probable, as that, by God's Order, they
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:50230:47"/> were ſlain for a Sacrifice to him, (the better to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent to them their Guilt, and that the promiſed Seed ſhould vanquiſh the Devil, and redeem them, by ſhedding his Blood,) and that of the Skins of thoſe Beaſts God directed Coats to be made, to cloath them? But whether, by dreſſing them and making Leather of them; or, only by drying them, and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Hair ſtill continue on them, we cannot tell. Certain it is, that this was a very ancient ſort of Cloathing; as we learn not only from Profane Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, but from the Sacred: Particularly,
<hi>Heb.</hi> XI. 37. The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors have carried this Matter ſo far, as to ſay, That <hi>Adam</hi> being a Prieſt, theſe were his Prieſtly Garments. The Skin indeed of the Burnt-Offering under the Law, is given to the Prieſt, <hi>Lev.</hi> VII. 8. but not to make him Cloaths: And
<hi>Eve,</hi> if this were true, muſt have been a Prieſt alſo; for ſhe had a Coat made of Skins, no leſs than <hi>Adam.</hi> Who, they fanſie, left this Coat to his Poſterity; ſo that <hi>Noah, Abraham,</hi> and all the reſt of the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> (as <hi>Abel</hi> they ſay did) ſacrificed in the very ſame Coat; till <hi>Aaron</hi> was made High-Prieſt, and had ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Garments appointed him by God.

<hi>SCHECHINAH,</hi> or <hi>Glorious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God,</hi> at the Entrance of the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> from which <hi>Adam</hi> had been expelled. For there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, no doubt, ſome ſetled Place, where they perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Sacred Offices; it is moſt reaſonable to think it had reſpect to the
<hi>SCHECHINAH,</hi> or <hi>Divine Majeſty.</hi> Whereſoever that appeared, there they <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared</hi> (as the Scripture ſpeaks) <hi>before God:</hi> Becauſe there he manifeſted his ſpecial Preſence, which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them to go thither to Worſhip him, to give him Thanks, or to <hi>enquire of him,</hi> as we read <hi>Rebekkah</hi> did, XXV. 22.</p>
               <p>What kind of Sacrifices theſe were, is a Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on among learned Men. The <hi>Talmudiſts</hi> are of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion they were <hi>whole Burnt-Offerings,</hi> and that there were no other before the Law was given, (which I ſhall not now examine,) nor would the <hi>Jews,</hi> after the giving of the Law, permit the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to offer any other at their Temple.</p>
               <p>It is their Opinion alſo, That <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> brought theſe Sacrifices to <hi>Adam,</hi> to be offered by him. For
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:50230:51"/> which I ſee no convincing Reaſon: But, rather, they themſelves ſeem to have offered them. And then this place effectually confutes their Opinion, who ſay the <hi>Firſt-born,</hi> were ſeparated to the Office of Prieſthood: For by theſe words it is plain, the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſacrificed, as well as the eldeſt. And ſo they did in following Ages; when we find <hi>Jacob</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the Office of a Prieſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> XXVIII. 18. XLVI. 1. Which proves their Opinion rather to be true; who ſay, That every Man anciently had the Power, in his own Family, to, do the Office of a Prieſt, as <hi>Job</hi> did, I. 5. But when Families combined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, under one Head, Prince, or Governor, he had the ſole Right of Sacrificing devolved to him, as their common Father. Thus
<hi>Melchizedeck</hi> was both <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Salem,</hi> and
<hi>Prieſt</hi> of the moſt High God. All which was taken away by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which permitted none to officiate among the
<hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> but the Family of <hi>Aaron;</hi> and no Sacrifices to be offered, but at the Tabernacle of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Lev.</hi> XVII. 3,
4, 5.</p>
               <p>It is a much harder Queſtion, How they came to ſacrifice at all; either <hi>Meal</hi> or <hi>Beaſts:</hi> Since we read of no Command from God requiring them to bring him ſuch Oblations: Which hath led ſome to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, That Men did this out of a grateful Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to return him ſome of his own Bleſſings; though they had no Directions from him about it. But if this were true, how came <hi>Abel</hi> to believe that his Sacrifice of a Beaſt, would be ſo acceptable to God, as the Apoſtle ſays it was
<hi>by Faith,</hi> Heb. XI. 4. That <hi>Faith</hi> had ſomething elſe to warrant it, than barely his own Reaſon. <hi>Adam,</hi> in all likelihood, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſome order concerning it; and began to <pb n="89" facs="tcp:50230:51"/> Sacrifice (as I noted before, III. 21.) by direction from the
<hi>SCHECHINAH</hi> or <hi>Divine Majeſty:</hi> From whence a Voice ſpake to him upon ſeveral oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, II. 16, 17. III. 8, 9, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Order in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is not recorded, no more than many other things which
<hi>Moſes</hi> in this ſhort Hiſtory omitted, (as <hi>Enoch</hi>'s Prophecy, <hi>Noah</hi>'s Preaching, the <hi>peopling of the World,</hi> &amp;c. See <hi>Verſe</hi> 15.) but it doth not ſeem probable that
<hi>Adam</hi> would have preſumed to invent a way of Worſhip, by killing Beaſts, and burning their Fat: Eſpecially ſince one cannot perceive any inclination to it in Nature. And therefore <hi>Euſebius</hi> very judiciouſly reſolves, in my opinion, that this way of Worſhip was not taken up by chance, or by a Humane motion,

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, it is not poſſible for our mortal Nature to know any thing about ſuch matters.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>And Abel he alſo brought of the Firſtling of his Flock,</hi> &amp;c.] Many have fanſied from hence, that <hi>Cain</hi>'s Guilt lay in this, that he did not bring the <hi>firſt of his Fruit,</hi> as he ought to have done, and as the Heathens ever did, or were bound to do by their Pontifical Laws, (as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> obſerves, Chap. I. of his
<hi>Hiſt. of Tythes</hi>) in their <hi>Praemeſſum,</hi> i. e. the Firſt-fruits of their Corn, or their <hi>Calpar,</hi> which was the richeſt of their Wine. For it is only ſaid, he brought <hi>of the Fruit of his Ground,</hi> when <hi>Abel</hi> brought <hi>of the firſtlings of his Flock.</hi> And <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo adding, <pb n="90" facs="tcp:50230:52"/> that
<hi>Abel</hi> brought <hi>of the Fat thereof,</hi> that is, the very beſt; they think <hi>Cain</hi>'s fault was, that he brought not the fulleſt Ears of Corn, (which he kept for himſelf) but the lankeſt, or brought them with a niggardly Hand, or a grudging Mind. Thus <hi>Palladius</hi> in the Life of St.
<hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſays, <hi>He was the firſt that taſted the Firſt-fruits, and kept the beſt things for his own Belly.</hi>

                  </gap>, p. 108. But there is no certainty of this; and the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> hath directed us to a better account, XI. 4. <hi>Abel</hi> offered with a pious Mind;
<hi>Cain</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a due Senſe of God, and ſincere Affection to him. He offered the Fruit of his Ground; but did not devote himſelf to God. Therefore it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The LORD had reſpect unto Abel and his Offering.</hi>] He graciouſly accepted them: and his Offering was accepted, becauſe he himſelf was accepted. It is a Metaphor from thoſe who when a Preſent is made to them, look kindly upon the Perſon that brings it, if they like him and his Preſent; or turn away their Face, if they diſdain them.</p>
               <p>How God teſtified his acceptance of <hi>Abel</hi>'s Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, is the only difficulty: Which the Jews ſay was by Fire coming from Heaven (or rather, I think, by a Stream of Light, or a Flame from the
<hi>SCHECHINAH,</hi> or glorious preſence of God, to whom it was offered) which burnt up his Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Thus <hi>Theodotion</hi> of old tranſlated theſe Words, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>But unto Cain and his Offering he had not reſpect.</hi>] He did not ſo much as ſhine upon his Sheaves; much leſs make them aſcend up to Heaven in a Smoak: Though he were the Elder Brother, and brought his Offering firſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And Cain was very wroth.</hi>] This highly incenſed him againſt <hi>Abel:</hi> When he ſhould have made ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Reflections on himſelf, and conſidered what it was that provoked God to ſlight his Sacrifice; that ſo he might amend it, and procure his favour. Unto which he had not a Title by his Birthright, but by his Piety. It is poſſible indeed that <hi>Eve</hi> might have inſtilled an Opinion into him, that he being the Firſt-born, was the Bleſſed Seed which God had promiſed. And then this may be conceived to have inraged him the more againſt his Brother; when he ſaw ſuch a diſtinguiſhing mark of God's ſpecial fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to him in the very act of Sacrificing. Which made him look upon <hi>Abel</hi> with a jealous Eye, and tempted him to kill him; that he might not ſupplant him in his hope, of being the fulfiller of the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle before-mentioned, III. 15.</p>

                  <hi>And his Countenance fell.</hi>] He did not meerly look dejectedly through grief; but knit his Brows, and had a down-look (as we ſpeak) lowring and cloudy: Like thoſe who have evil deſigns in their Heads, and meditate nothing but Revenge.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>And the LORD ſaid unto Cain,</hi> &amp;c.] He did not intend wholly to caſt off <hi>Cain,</hi> by refuſing his Sacrifice, it is plain, I think, by this Queſtion. Which was, in effect, to tell him, He had no reaſon to be angry, or out of humour; but only to become a better Man: And then God would have reſpect unto him alſo. So it follows,</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>If thou doſt well, ſhalt thou not be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> &amp;c.] There are vaſt varieties in the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of this Verſe, with which I ſhall not trouble the Reader. (See <hi>Theodorick Hakſpan,</hi> L. I. <hi>Miſcel. C.</hi> 4. <hi>Mercer,</hi> and <hi>L. de Dieu,</hi> different from all, with Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi>) but only give the Sence of our Tranſlation. <hi>If thou doſt well, ſhalt thou not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted?</hi> Canſt thou doubt that I have an Impartial reſpect to true Goodneſs, whereſoever I find it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But if thou doſt not well, Sin</hi> (that is, the puniſhment of Sin, as <hi>Verſe</hi> 13. XIX. 15. and many other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces)

               <p>
                  <hi>And unto thee ſhall be his deſire, and thou ſhalt rule over him.</hi>] He is ſtill thy younger Brother, and ſhall be ſubject to thee, (See III. 16.) and thou ſhalt be his Superiour. So here are
<hi>Three</hi> things ſuggeſted to <hi>Cain,</hi> to appeaſe his anger againſt his Brother. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the reaſon of his not being reſpected, was not in his Brother, but in himſelf: Who, if he would do well, as <hi>Abel</hi> had done, ſhould find favour no leſs than he.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> That there was no reaſon <pb n="94" facs="tcp:50230:54"/> he that did ill ſhould fare like him that did well; but quite contrary, ſhould feel the marks of God's diſpleaſure. And yet, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This ſhould not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his civil right, nor give <hi>Abel</hi> any Authority over him: But he ſhould ſtill retain the Privilege of his Birth-right; and need fear no harm from his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who was his inferiour.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>And Cain talked with Abel his Brother.</hi>] Asked him in a friendly manner (as one Brother ſpeaks to another) if he would walk into the Fields. This ſeems more likely to me, than that he told him how the LORD had chidden him, (as <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> interprets it) or that he diſputed with him about the other World, and the Judgment to come, as others of them expound it. Which Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> very judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly concludes to have ariſen from <hi>Onkelos</hi> his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſe on the fore-going Verſe, which is this; <hi>If thou amend thy Worſhip</hi> (or Service of me)
<hi>ſhalt thou not be pardoned? but if thou doſt not amend it, thy ſin ſhall remain to the day of Judgment, in which thou ſhalt be puniſhed, if thou doſt not repent.</hi> Upon which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in ſome Editions of the

                  <hi>Cain roſe up againſt Abel his Brother.</hi>] Aſſaulted him on a ſudden; took him at an Advantage.</p>

<hi>Salvian</hi> indeed (<hi>L.</hi> I. <hi>de gubern.

               <p>
                  <hi>And the LORD ſet a mark upon Cain,</hi> &amp;c.] What this
<hi>Mark</hi> was, we muſt be content to be ignorant. Some think God ſtigmatized him with a Letter of his Name, in his Forehead; (or, rather, I ſhould think, ſet ſuch a Brand upon him, as ſignified him to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed;) others, That he look'd moſt frightfully, ſo that every Body avoided him; or, that his Head ſhaked continually; or, (as others) he had a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling in his whole Body; or, his Face, perhaps, was blaſted by Lightning from the Preſence of the LORD. Certain it is, that it was ſome notorious Mark of God's Diſpleaſure: Which made Men ſhun him. For we muſt not imagine there was no Body in the World, at this time, but <hi>Adam, Eve,</hi> and <hi>Cain:</hi> But conſider that the Deſign of this Holy Book is not to give us a particular Account of the whole Race of Mankind deſcended from
<hi>Adam,</hi> (who, no doubt, had a great many more Children than
<hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel;</hi> and they alſo bad Children before this hapned,) but only of thoſe Perſons who were moſt remarkable; and whoſe Story was neceſſary to be known, for the <pb n="99" facs="tcp:50230:56"/> underſtanding of the Succeſſion down to <hi>Moſes</hi> his time. Accordingly we read, preſently after this, that <hi>Cain</hi> had a Wife; and more than that, he built a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Which ſuppoſes a great Company of People to inhabit it, <hi>verſe</hi> 17. And here, by the way, we need not wonder, there is no mention made of the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Sacrifices; when the firſt Peopling of the World is only ſuppoſed, not related.</p>
               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>And Cain went out.</hi>] Not voluntarily, but by the force of the Divine Curſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>From the preſence of the LORD.</hi>] There was a
<hi>Divine Glory,</hi> called by the <hi>Jews</hi> the <hi>SHECHINAH,</hi> which appeared from the beginning, (as I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſaid before,) the ſight of which <hi>Cain</hi> never after this enjoyed; but was baniſhed from it: And God withdrawing his gracious Preſence from him, (ſo St.
<hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi>) he was alſo forſaken by him, and put out of his ſpecial Protection. If <hi>Cain,</hi> after this, turned a down-right Idolater (as many think) it is very likely he introduced the Worſhip of the
<hi>Sun,</hi> (which was the moſt ancient ſort of Idolatry,) as the beſt reſemblance he could find of the <hi>Glory of the LORD:</hi> Which was wont to appear in a flaming Light. And in after-times they worſhipped
<hi>Fire</hi> in the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Countries; as the beſt Emblem of the
<hi>Sun,</hi> when it was abſent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And dwelt in the Land of Nod.</hi>] At laſt he ſetled in a Country, which had the Name of <hi>Nod;</hi> from his wandring up and down, like a Vagabond, till he fixed here. Where, it ſeems, he ſtill continued reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, moving from one part of the Country to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till, in concluſion, <hi>he built a City,</hi> (for his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, ſome think,) as we read in the <hi>Verſe</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>And Cain knew his Wife.</hi>] There hath been no mention hitherto of any Woman in the World but <hi>Eve,</hi> much leſs of
<hi>Cain</hi>'s having a Wife. And therefore it is uncertain whether this were a Wife he took before he killed his Brother, or after. It is moſt probable before; becauſe we may well think all the World abhorred the thoughts of Marriage, with ſuch an impious Murderer, whom God alſo had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed. But whether it were before or after; I ſee no reaſon to conclude that this Wife was his Siſter: There being Women enough in the World beſide, before this time, as was ſaid before, <hi>verſe</hi> 15. For even in our Country, in the Age before us, there <pb n="101" facs="tcp:50230:57"/> ſprung from two Perſons,
<hi>Three hundred ſixty ſeven</hi> Children, within the ſpace of
<hi>eighty</hi> Years. And therefore, the World being now (when <hi>Cain</hi> ſlew <hi>Abel</hi>) an <hi>Hundred and twenty eight,</hi> or an <hi>Hundred and thirty</hi> Years old, according to Arch-Biſhop <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> and
<hi>Jac. Capellus</hi>'s Chronology, we cannot but conceive there were a great Number of People in it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from all thoſe Sons and Daughters which
<hi>Adam</hi> begot, <hi>Chap.</hi> V. 4. We are not told how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but ſome of the ancient <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Traditions (in <hi>Cedrenus</hi>) ſay, he had <hi>thirty three</hi> Sons, and <hi>twenty ſeven</hi> Daughters.</p>
               <p>It is true indeed, That at the firſt <hi>Cain</hi> could mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry none but one of his Siſters. Which was then Lawful, becauſe abſolutely neceſſary: But prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by God, when that Neceſſity ceaſed. Of which the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> People were ſo ſenſible, that they took care to have it thought, that <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> did not marry thoſe who were neareſt of kin to him, but thoſe that were at ſome diſtance. For their Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, That <hi>Eve,</hi> at her two firſt Births, brought Twins, a Son and a Daughter, <hi>viz. Cain</hi> with his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Azron,</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> with his Siſter <hi>Awin;</hi> as
<hi>Saidus Patricides</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria</hi> reports. Now, ſuch was their Caution, not to match with thoſe that were neareſt in Blood, but with thoſe further off, as much as was then poſſible;
<hi>Cain</hi> was not ſuffered to marry his Twin-Siſter, nor <hi>Abel</hi> his: But <hi>Adam</hi> gave <hi>Awin</hi> to <hi>Cain,</hi> and <hi>Azron</hi> to <hi>Abel.</hi> I cannot vouch the truth of this Story: Which I mention only to ſhow, That Mankind have had a Senſe, that all poſſible Care ſhould be uſed, to avoid Marriages with the neareſt Relations: For though this Story was derived, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, from the <hi>Jews,</hi> yet it was believed by other <pb n="102" facs="tcp:50230:58"/> People. See Mr. <hi>Selden, L.</hi> V. <hi>De Jure N. &amp; G. c.</hi> 8. Whence <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> ſays, <hi>Lib.</hi> I. it was <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

               <p>
                  <hi>And he built a City.</hi>] Not as ſoon as the came into this Country; but when he had a numerous Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, able to people it: And conſequently in his old Age. His end in building it, ſome think, was to croſs the Curſe of wandring to and fro: Others, to defend himſelf againſt thoſe whom his guilty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience made him fear; or, to ſecure the Spoils which by force and violence (as <hi>Joſephus</hi> relates,
<hi>L.</hi> I. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiq. c.</hi> 3.) he had taken from others. There are thoſe, who imagine, that when he attempted to build this City, he often broke off the Work, out of a panick fear: Such an one as <hi>Romulus</hi> felt, after he had killed his Brother <hi>Remus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And called the Name of the City, after the Name of his Son.</hi>] Some think he declined his own Name, becauſe he knew it to be odious every where. But it is more likely, it was for that reaſon, which moved Men in after-times to do the ſame. For it hath been a very ancient Uſage, for great Men to call the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which they built by the Name of their Sons, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than their own: Out of the great Love they bare to their Children. Thus <hi>Nimrod</hi> called <hi>Nineveh</hi> after the Name of his Son <hi>Ninus.</hi> Which the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt</hi> 
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:50230:58"/> notes as a piece of the Vanity of Mankind, <hi>to call their Lands</hi> (that is, the <hi>Houſes</hi> where they dwelt, as <hi>R. Solomon Jarchi</hi> interprets it) <hi>by their own Names,</hi> to be a laſting Monument of them and of their Family.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Enoch.</hi>] There were an ancient People called by
<hi>Pliny, Heniochi;</hi> by <hi>Mela, Eniochi;</hi> and by <hi>Lucan, Enochii:</hi> Some of which lived ſo far <hi>Eaſtward,</hi> that Sir <hi>W. Raleigh</hi> fanſies they might be the Poſterity of this

               </p>
               <p>Ver. 18. <hi>And unto Enoch was born Irad,</hi> &amp;c.] It is remarkable, that though <hi>Moſes</hi> gives us ſome Account of the Deſcendants of <hi>Cain;</hi> yet he ſaith not a word of the Years that they lived, and carries their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogy but a little way. Whereas he deduces the Genealogy of <hi>Seth</hi> down to the Flood, and ſo to his own time,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And alſo relates particularly, (<hi>Chap.</hi> V.) to what Age the Life of his principal Poſterity was prolonged. It ſeems, he look'd upon <hi>Cain</hi>'s Race, as ſuch a Reprobate Generation, that he would not number them in the Book of the Living: As St. <hi>Cyril</hi> ſpeaks.</p>
               <p>Ver. 19. <hi>Lamech took unto him two Wives.</hi>] By a ſmall tranſpoſition of Letters, <hi>Lamech</hi> being the ſame with
<hi>Melech,</hi> which ſignifies a <hi>King;</hi> ſome of the <hi>Jews</hi> fanſie him to have been a great Man: For none but ſuch, they ſay, had two Wives in thoſe ancient Times: Though they hold it was lawful (as
<hi>Selden</hi> ſhows, <hi>L.</hi> V. <hi>De Jure N. &amp; G. cap.</hi> 6.) for any Body that could maintain them, to have had more. But it is more likely that <hi>Lamech</hi> was the firſt, that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured to tranſgreſs the Original Inſtitution: Which was obſerved even by the <hi>Cainites</hi> till this time. When, perhaps, his earneſt deſire of ſeeing
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:50230:59"/> that <hi>bleſſed Seed</hi> which was promiſed to
<hi>Eve,</hi> might induce him to take more Wives than one: Hoping, by multiplying his Poſterity, ſome or other of them might prove ſo happy as to produce that <hi>Seed.</hi> And this he might poſſibly perſuade himſelf was the more likely; becauſe the Right that was in <hi>Cain</hi> the Firſt-born, he might now conclude was revived in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: Who being the <hi>Seventh</hi> from <hi>Cain,</hi> had ſome reaſon to imagine the Curſe laid upon him, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing puniſhed, <hi>ſevenfold,</hi> i. e. for
<hi>ſeven</hi> Generations, was now expired; and his Poſterity reſtored to the Right of fulfilling the Promiſe.</p>
               <p>Ver. 20. <hi>He was the Father.</hi>] The <hi>Hebrews</hi> call him the <hi>Father</hi> of any thing; who was the firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venter of it; or, a moſt excellent Maſter in that Art. Such was <hi>Jabal</hi> in the Art of making Tents, folding Flocks, and all other parts of Paſtorage. Which though begun by <hi>Abel,</hi> was not by him brought to Perfection: Or, if it were,

               <p>

So that the Sence of this whole <hi>Verſe</hi> ſeems to be, That though Men fed Cattle before in good Paſtures; yet <hi>Jabal</hi> was the firſt that, by the Invention of Tents, made the more Deſart Countries ſerviceable to them: Where, when they had eaten up all the Graſs in one place, they might in a little time take up their Tents, and fix them in another. To this purpoſe <hi>R. Solomon Jarchi.</hi> And in theſe Tents, it's likely, he taught them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their Cattle, as well as themſelves, from Heat and Cold, and all other Dangers to which they were expoſed in thoſe Deſart Places.</p>

<hi>Hear my Voice, ye Wives of Lamech, hearken unto my Speech.</hi>] Something had preceded theſe Words, which was the occaſion of them: But it is hard to find what it was. <hi>Jacobus Capellus</hi> indeed (in his <hi>Hiſtoria Sacra &amp; Exotica</hi>) hath a Conceit that <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mech</hi> was now in a vapouring Humor, being puffed up with the glory of his Son's Inventions; to whoſe

<hi>Cain</hi> to be now alive. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Lud. de Dieu,</hi> following
<hi>Onkelos,</hi> reads the Words by way of Interrogation; <hi>Have I ſlain a Man? Or, ſo much as a Boy?</hi> that you ſhould be affraid of my Life? It ſeems the uſe of Weapons being found out by one of his Sons, and grown common; his Wives apprehended that ſome Body or other might make uſe of them to ſlay him. But he bids them Comfort themſelves, for he was not guilty of ſlay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Body himſelf; and therefore might reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably hope, no Body would hurt him.</p>
               <p>And then the meaning of the next <hi>Verſe</hi> is eaſie.</p>
               <p>Ver. 24. <hi>If Cain ſhall be avenged ſeven fold, truly Lamech ſeventy and ſeven fold.</hi> If God hath guarded <hi>Cain</hi> ſo ſtrongly, who was a Murderer, as to threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten great and long Puniſhments to thoſe that ſlay him; he will puniſh them far more, and purſue them with a longer Vengeance, who ſhall ſlay me, being a guiltleſs Perſon.</p>
               <p>There are divers other Interpretations, which I ſhall not mention; becauſe this is moſt pertinent to the preceding diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>Ver. 25. <hi>Bare a Son.</hi>] The <hi>Jews</hi> think he was born a Year after <hi>Abel</hi> was killed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And called his Name Seth.</hi>] Mothers anciently gave Names to their Children, as well as the Fathers. <pb n="108" facs="tcp:50230:61"/> And
<hi>Eve</hi> gave this Son, the Name of <hi>Seth;</hi> becauſe ſhe look'd upon him as <hi>appointed</hi> (ſo the word ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies) by God, to be what
<hi>Cain,</hi> ſhe thought, ſhould have been; till God rejected his Sacrifice, and he ſlew <hi>Abel.</hi> In whoſe room ſhe believed God had ſubſtituted this Son, to be the Seed from whom the Redeemer of the World ſhould come.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Arabians</hi> ſay, (particularly <hi>Elmacinus, p.</hi> 7.) That <hi>Seth</hi> was the Inventer of <hi>Letters</hi> and
<hi>Writing,</hi> (as <hi>Jubal</hi> was of Muſick, and <hi>Tubal-Cain</hi> of Arms,) which ſo much ſurpaſſed all other Inventions, that ſome (as
<hi>Cedrenus</hi> tells us) called him, <hi>a God; i. e.</hi> the higheſt Benefactor to Mankind. Which, if it were true, we might think that thence his Children were called <hi>the Sons of God,</hi> VI. 1. But it is moſt likely this miſtake aroſe from <hi>Symmachus</hi> his Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the laſt Words of the next <hi>Verſe,</hi> which, if we may believe <hi>Suidas,</hi> was thus, <hi>Then began Seth to be called by the Name of God.</hi> For which there is no Foundation either there, or any where elſe in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. For though it be ſaid that <hi>Moſes</hi> was made <hi>a God to Pharaoh,</hi> yet he is never ſimply called a God, as <hi>Jacobus Capellus</hi> well obſerves. Nor is any King, or Prince called by that Name particularly, in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; though in general it ſays of them all, That <hi>they are Gods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 26. <hi>To him alſo was born a Son.</hi>] When he was an Hundred and five Years old, as we read, V. 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he called his Name, Enos.</hi>] Signifying the weak and miſerable Condition of Mankind; which he ſeemed, by giving him this Name, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:50230:61"/>
                  <hi>Then began Men to call upon the Name of the LORD.</hi>] This doth not import that Men did not <hi>call upon the LORD</hi> (which includes all his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Service) before this time: But that now (as <hi>Jac. Capellus</hi> conceives) they were awakned, by the Conſideration of their Infirmity before-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, to be more ſerious and frequent in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Offices: Or, rather, (as others underſtand it,) they began to hold more Publick Aſſemblies. For Families being now multiplied, to which Religion was before confined, they joyned together and met in larger Societies and Communion, for the ſolemn Worſhip of God by Sacrifices, and other Religious Services. For, to <hi>call upon God,</hi> comprehends, as I ſaid, all Religion: Which conſiſts in acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to be the LORD of all; in lauding all his Glorious Perfections; giving him Thanks for his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits; and beſeeching the Continuance of them.</p>
               <p>But it being ſcarce credible, that Publick Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies were not held long before this, (it being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that even when
<hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> ſacrificed, their Families joyned together to worſhip God,) it hath moved ſome Men of note, (ſuch as <hi>Bertram</hi> and <hi>Hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpan,</hi>) to follow our Marginal Tranſlation; <hi>then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Men</hi> (i. e. the Children of <hi>Seth,</hi>) <hi>to call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by the Name of the LORD:</hi> That is, the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants or Worſhippers of the Lord; in diſtinction from the <hi>Cainites,</hi> and ſuch prophane Perſons, as had forſaken him.</p>
               <p>And indeed a great Number of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, with whom Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> joyns, in his <hi>De Diis Syris, Prolegom.</hi>
3. would have the Words expounded thus, to ſignifie that Apoſtaſie;
<hi>then was there prophanation, by invoking the Name of the LORD.</hi> For the word <pb n="110" facs="tcp:50230:62"/> 
                  <hi>hochal,</hi> which we here tranſlate
<hi>began,</hi> ſignifying <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned,</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> XIX. 12. (<hi>Thou ſhalt not prophane the Name of the LORD thy God,</hi>) they take
<hi>Moſes</hi> his meaning to be, <hi>That the moſt Holy Name which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Creator and Poſſeſſor of Heaven and Earth alone, was now impiouſly given unto Creatures:</hi> Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to the Sun. And thus the <hi>Arabick</hi> interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in <hi>Expenius</hi> his Edition, <hi>Then began Men to apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatize from the worſhip of God.</hi> But a great Number of very learned Men have oppoſed themſelves to this Interpretation; and with much Judgment: <hi>Moſes</hi> being here ſpeaking of the Pious Family of <hi>Seth,</hi> and not of Impious <hi>Cain</hi>'s: And the word
<hi>hochal</hi> (as <hi>Hackspan</hi> obſerves) with the Prepoſition
<hi>le</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the next word, being conſtantly uſed in the Sence of <hi>beginnings,</hi> not of <hi>prophanation.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they content themſelves with our Marginal Tranſlation: Or, elſe think that God was now firſt called upon by the Name of <hi>Jehovah:</hi> Or, that
<hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies,</hi> as we call them, or Publick Forms of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip were now appointed, at ſet Hours: Or, ſome other conſiderable Improvements made in Religious Offices. For the <hi>Arabian</hi> Chriſtians repreſent this
<hi>Enos</hi> as an excellent Governor: Who, while he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, preſerved his Family in good order, and when he died, called them all together; and gave them a Charge to keep God's Commandments, and not to aſſociate themſelves with the Children of <hi>Cain.</hi> So <hi>Elmacinus.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>In the likeneſs of God created he him.</hi>] This alſo is again mentioned; to remember Men how highly God had honoured them, and how ſhamefully they had requited him.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>Male and Female created he them,</hi> &amp;c.] Of different Sexes, to be joyned together in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Marriage: As <hi>Moſes</hi> had ſhown, <hi>Chap.</hi> II. 22, 23, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>And begat a Son in his own likeneſs, after his image.</hi>] Not ſo Perfect as himſelf, when he was created; but with thoſe Imperfections which impaired him, after he had eaten the forbidden Fruit: That is, inclined to Sin, and ſubject to Death.

                  <hi>Maimonides</hi> will have this to referr to <hi>Seth</hi>'s Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Goodneſs; he proving truly a Man like to his Father

<hi>Patriarchs,</hi> by the ſhortneſs of ours. <pb n="113" facs="tcp:50230:63"/> For, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> well obſerves, (<hi>L.</hi> I. <hi>Antiq. cap.</hi> 4. and out of him, <hi>Euſebius, L.</hi> IX. <hi>Praepar. Evang. cap.</hi> 13.) they being Men much beloved of God, and newly made by him, with a ſtrong Conſtitution, and excellent Temper of Body, and uſing better Diet, the Vigor of the Earth ſerving at the firſt, for the Production of better Fruits: All theſe things, joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their Temperance, conſtant Exerciſe and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, a ſweet Temper of Air, their Knowledge in the Nature of Herbs and Plants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> might well contribute very much, to as long a Life as is here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. Which was but neceſſary alſo, (and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God's Providence took ſpecial Care of them,) that the World might be the ſooner peopled; Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Religion more certainly propagated, by the Authority of living Teachers; Arts and Sciences brought to a great Perfection, which could not have been effected in a ſhort Life, like ours. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſhows, that herein <hi>Moſes</hi> hath the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of all the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Barbarians</hi> alſo: Who have wrote about ancient Affairs: Of <hi>Manethus</hi> (for inſtance) who wrote the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Hiſtory; <hi>Bero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> who wrote the
<hi>Chaldaean; Mochus, Heſtiaeus,</hi> &amp;c. who wrote the
<hi>Phoenician;</hi> with a great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Greek</hi> Writers whom he mentions: Who all ſay, Men lived anciently a <hi>thouſand</hi> Years. None indeed came up to that full Summ; but ſome ſo near it, that they who were not exactly acquainted with the Sacred Story, might well ſpeak in that manner.</p>
               <p>And this ought not to ſeem incredible to us in theſe Days, when we conſider how long ſeveral have lived in the later Ages of the World; as <hi>Pliny</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports in his <hi>Natural Hiſtory, L.</hi> VII.
<hi>cap.</hi> 48. Nay, in <pb n="114" facs="tcp:50230:64"/> Times nearer to us, there are Inſtances of this kind, as the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> obſerves in his
<hi>Hiſt. Vitae &amp; mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis;</hi> and <hi>Bartholin.</hi> in his
<hi>Hiſtor. Anatom. Rariorum; Cent.</hi> V. <hi>Hiſt.</hi> 28.</p>
               <p>But nothing is more remarkable than that which
<hi>Gaffendus</hi> reports in the Life of <hi>Nicol. Peirskius, L.</hi> V. That he received a Letter from <hi>Aleppo,</hi> no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ago than the Year 1636, of a Man then in <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> known to ſeveral Perſons worthy to be believed, who was <hi>Four hundred</hi> Years old: <hi>Idque ipſis omnino eſſe exploratum, atque indubium:</hi> And the Perſons that wrote this, were fully aſſured of the undoubted Truth of it.</p>
               <p>Such Inſtances indeed are rare; and there is one that thinks Men did not generally live to ſuch a great Age in the old World. For
<hi>Maimonides</hi> is of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, That none attained to ſo many Years as are here mentioned; but only the particular Perſons ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly named by
<hi>Moſes:</hi> All the reſt of Mankind, in thoſe Days, living only the ordinary term, which Man did in after-times. Or, in other words, this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary length of Days, was the Privilege on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of theſe ſingular Individuals; either from their accurate way of Living and Diet, or God's ſpecial Favour in Reward of their eminent Vertue and Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>More Nevoch. Par.</hi> II. <hi>cap.</hi> 47. But <hi>Nachmanides</hi> (another great
<hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctor) oppoſes this with much Reaſon; For that their eminent Vertue was not the cauſe they alone had this Privilege, appears by
<hi>Enoch,</hi> the moſt holy Man of them all, who did not live to the Age of
<hi>Four hundred</hi> Years. And as there is no ground to believe theſe were the only Perſons who lived exactly Temperate in all things: So it is manifeſt <hi>Moſes</hi> doth not deſign to give us an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:50230:64"/> of thoſe that lived longeſt, but of thoſe from whom
<hi>Noah</hi> deſcended, and it is incredible that they alone ſhould be very long lived, and no Body elſe, though deſcended from the ſame Parents.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>And Seth lived an hundred and five Years, and begat Enos.</hi>] We muſt not think he lived ſo long, before he begat any Children: No more than that <hi>Adam</hi> had none till he was an <hi>Hundred and thirty</hi> Years old, when he begat <hi>Seth,</hi> (<hi>verſe</hi> 3.) for we know he had <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> and, in all likelihood, many others before. Therefore to explain this and other things that follow,
<hi>verſe</hi> 18. and 28. which ſeem more ſtrange (for <hi>Jared</hi> is ſaid to have lived an <hi>Hundred ſixty two</hi> Years, before he begat
<hi>Enoch;</hi> and <hi>Lamech</hi> an <hi>Hundred eighty two</hi> Years before he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat <hi>Noah,</hi>) we muſt conſider, as was noted, <hi>verſe</hi>
4. that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſets down only thoſe Perſons by whom the Line of
<hi>Noah</hi> was drawn from <hi>Seth,</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Line from
<hi>Noah,</hi> by their true Anceſtors; whether they were the Eldeſt of the Family or no. <hi>Seth</hi> it's likely had many other Children before
<hi>Enos</hi> was born, as <hi>Noah,</hi> we may be confident had before he begat <hi>Sem, Ham,</hi> and <hi>Japhet:</hi> Which was not till he was
<hi>Five hundred</hi> Years old, <hi>verſe</hi> 32. As <hi>Lamech</hi> alſo had ſeveral before <hi>Noah</hi> was born: Though <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> doth not mention them; becauſe he was here concerned only to inform us, who was the Father of <hi>Noah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Begat Enos.</hi>] The <hi>Arabian</hi> Chriſtians, as I obſerved before, (IV. 26.) make him to have been a man of ſingular Goodneſs.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>Begat Cainan.</hi>] The ſame Writers repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent him to have been like to his Father; and ſay, he gave his Children a charge not to mingle with the <pb n="116" facs="tcp:50230:65"/> Seed of <hi>Cain.</hi> So
<hi>Elmacinus.</hi> Yet there is but little difference between his
<hi>Name,</hi> and that of <hi>Cain</hi>'s; no more than between <hi>Irad</hi> and <hi>Jared,</hi> and ſome other of <hi>Sem</hi>'s Poſterity and
<hi>Cain</hi>'s. Which may teach us, ſays <hi>Jac. Capellus,</hi> (in his
<hi>Hiſtor. Sacra &amp; Exotica,</hi>) <hi>Ne fatale neſcio quod omen nominibus propriis effinga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus;</hi> that we ſhould not fanſie there is, we do not know what, fatal Omen in Proper Names. The Wickedneſs of <hi>Judas Iſcariot</hi> did not make the other <hi>Judas,</hi> called by that Name, to think the worſe of it. And therefore <hi>Jared</hi> feared not to call his Son <hi>Enoch,</hi> by the very Name of <hi>Cain</hi>'s eldeſt Son, IV. 17. And <hi>Methuſelah</hi> alſo gave his Son <hi>Lamech,</hi> the Name of one of <hi>Cain</hi>'s Grand-Children, IV. 18.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>Begat Mahalaleel.</hi>] This Name imports as much as <hi>a Praiſer of God:</hi> Which <hi>Cainan</hi> impoſed upon this Son of his, (as <hi>Jacobus Capellus</hi> fanſies,) becauſe he was born after he had lived <hi>ten Weeks</hi> of Years, (<hi>i. e.</hi> when he was Seventy Years old,) in the beginning of the <hi>Sabbatick</hi> Year: Which was the Eighth <hi>Jubilee</hi> from the Creation. For, as there were
<hi>Sacrifices,</hi> and a diſtinction of <hi>clean</hi> Beaſts and
<hi>unclean;</hi> ſo he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives there might be a diſtribution of Years by <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens</hi> or <hi>Weeks,</hi> (as they ſpake in after-times,) from the very beginning of the World. But there is no certainty of this: Nor of what the fore-named <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian</hi> Writers ſay of this <hi>Mahalaleel,</hi> that he made his Children ſwear, by the Blood of <hi>Abel,</hi> (ſo
<hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides,</hi>) not to come down from the Mountainous Country where they dwelt, to converſe with the Children of <hi>Cain.</hi>

And thence they fanſie he was called <hi>Jared,</hi> (which ſignifies <hi>deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi>) either becauſe they went down from the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mountain, as they call it, where,

<hi>He ſhall make our Labour in tilling the Earth, more eaſie and leſs toilſome to us.</hi> Which agrees to what follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Becauſe of the Ground which the LORD hath curſed.</hi>] There was a general Curſe upon it, for the Sin of <hi>Adam;</hi> and a particular upon ſome part of it, for the Sin of <hi>Cain:</hi> Now God, he foretells, would take them both off in great meaſure; and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:50230:67"/> bleſs the Earth to the poſterity of <hi>this ſame Man:</hi> Who perfected the Art of Husbandry, and found out fitter Inſtruments for plowing the Earth, than had been known before. When
<hi>Men</hi> being chiefly imployed in digging and throwing up the Earth with their own Hands, their labour was more difficult: Which now is much abated, becauſe the pains lie more upon <hi>Beaſts</hi> than upon <hi>Men.</hi> And indeed <hi>Noah</hi> is called, IX. 20. <hi>Iſch haadamah,</hi> a Man of the Ground (which we tranſlate <hi>an Husbandman</hi>) one that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
<hi>Agriculture,</hi> as other famous Men had done <hi>Paſtorage,</hi> and found out other Arts, IV. 20, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In the ſame place alſo (IX. 20.) we read that <hi>Noah</hi> planted a <hi>Vineyard:</hi> With reſpect to which, if he was the firſt inventor of making Wine, he might well be ſaid here, to <hi>comfort them concerning their work and toil of their hands:</hi> Wine chearing the Heart, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving the Spirits of Men, that are ſpent with Labour.</p>
               <p>But if the laſt Words of this Verſe be expounded of the

               <p>It doth not follow that <hi>Shem</hi> was the Eldeſt of theſe Three, becauſe he is here, and every where elſe in this Book, mentioned firſt: For I ſhall ſhow plainly in its due place that
<hi>Japhet</hi> was the Eldeſt. (X. 21.) <hi>Scaliger</hi> indeed would have this a ſetled Rule, that, <hi>Hunc Ordinem Filii in Scriptura habent, quem illis natura dedit.</hi> That Children are placed in Scripture, according to the Order which Nature hath given them. But it is apparent from many Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that the Scripture hath regard to their Dignity otherways, and not to the Order of their Birth. As <hi>Abraham</hi> is mentioned before
<hi>Nahor</hi> and <hi>Haran, merite excellentiae,</hi> with reſpect to his Excellence (as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks) to which God raiſed him, though he was not the Eldeſt Son of <hi>Terah, Gen.</hi> XI. 28. Thus

<hi>Iſaac</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> I. 28. Thus
<hi>Shem</hi>'s Eminence in other reſpects, placed him before
<hi>Japhet,</hi> to whom he was inferiour in the order of Nature: As appears even from their <hi>Genealogy</hi> both in <hi>Gen.</hi> X. and 1

<hi>clean Beaſts</hi> in this place, are ſuch as are not rapacious; which were not to be offered unto God.

Some ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, That they conſidered the Nature of Beaſts, and by common Reaſon determined that ravenous Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were unfit for Sacrifice: But it is more likely that they had Directions from God for this, as they had for Sacrificing.

               <p>
                  <hi>All the Fountains of the great deep were broken up,</hi> &amp;c.] Here are two Cauſes aſſigned of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge: <hi>Firſt,</hi> The breaking up the Fountains of the great Deep: And, <hi>Secondly, The opening the Windows of Heaven.</hi> By the <hi>great Deep</hi> is meant, thoſe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that are contained in vaſt quantities, within the Bowels of the Earth. Which being preſſed upward, by the falling down of the Earth, or ſome other Cauſe unknown to us, guſhed out violently at ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts of the Earth, where they either found or made a vent. For that's meant by
<hi>breaking up the Fountains</hi> of the great Deep: The great holes, or rather gaps that were made in the Earth; at which thoſe ſubterraneous Waters burſt out. This joined with the continual Rains for <hi>forty</hi> Days together, might well make ſuch a Flood, as is here deſcribed. For Rain came down not in ordinary Showers, but in Floods; Which <hi>Moſes</hi> calls opening the <hi>Windows,</hi> or <hi>Flood-gates</hi> of Heaven: And the LXX tranſlate <hi>Cataracts.</hi> Which they can beſt underſtand, who have ſeen thoſe fallings of Waters in the <hi>Indies,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Spouts:</hi> Where Clouds do not break into Drops, but fall with a terrible violence, in a Torrent. In ſhort, it is evident from this Hiſtory, that the Waters did once cover the Earth, (we know not how deep,) ſo that nothing of the Earth could be ſeen, till God ſeparated them, and raiſed ſome into Clouds, and <pb n="139" facs="tcp:50230:76"/> made the reſt fall into Channels, which were made for them, and commanded dry Land to appear, <hi>Gen.</hi> I. 2, 7,
10. Therefore it is no wonder, if theſe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were raiſed up again, by ſome means or other, to cover the Earth as before: Eſpecially when the Waters above the Firmament, came down to join with thoſe below, as they did at the beginning.</p>
               <p>This ſome wiſe Heathen look'd upon as a poſſible thing. For <hi>Seneca</hi> treating of that <hi>fatal Day,</hi> (as he calls it,
<hi>L.</hi> III. <hi>Nat. Queſt. c.</hi> 27.) when the <hi>Deluge ſhall come,</hi> (for he fanſied it ſtill Future,) queſtions how <hi>it</hi> may come to paſs. Whether by the force of the Ocean overflowing the Earth; or, by perpetual Rains without intermiſſion; or, by the ſwelling of Rivers, and the opening of new Fountains; or, there ſhall not be one Cauſe alone of ſo great a miſchief; but all theſe things concurr, <hi>uno agmine ad exitium humani generis,</hi> in one Troop to the Deſtruction of Mankind. Which laſt Reſolution, he thinks, is the Truth, both there, and in the laſt <hi>Chapter</hi> of that Book.

               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>In the ſelf-ſame Day,</hi> &amp;c.] In that very Day, when the Rain began, did <hi>Noah</hi> and his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> finiſh their going into the Ark. Which could not be done in a Day or two; but required a good deal of time: And now he had compleated it; the very laſt Creature being there beſtowed. For, it is likely, he put in all other things firſt; and then went in himſelf, with his Wife, and Children, and their Wives: Who were no ſooner entred, but the Waters brake in upon the Earth from beneath; and came down pouring from above.</p>
               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>The LORD ſhut him in.</hi>] Or, ſhut the Door after him: Cloſed it ſo faſt, that the Waters could not enter, though it was not pitched, as the reſt of the Ark.

<hi>Q.</hi> 34. But they are confuted by theſe Words, and by other Paſſages, which ſay all Fleſh died.

Therefore it is a ſtrange weakneſs to fanſie, that only <hi>Palaeſtine, Syria,</hi> or <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> or ſome ſuch Country, was drowned by the Flood; no more of the Earth being then inhabited: For thoſe Countries could not have held the <hi>fortieth</hi> part of the Inhabitants, which were produced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Creation and the Flood; no, all the Earth

For there is no Mountain above <hi>thirty</hi> Miles high, upright; which <hi>thirty</hi> Miles being found in the Depths of the Earth,

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:50230:80"/> again, becauſe it was firſt clear'd from the Water; being the higheſt of all other Countries in the World.</p>
               <p>Thus their Argument runs in <hi>Juſtin, L.</hi> II.
<hi>c.</hi> 1. where he hath given us a brief relation of it, (if we had

Elieſer,</hi> who ſaith, (<hi>Pirke, c.</hi> 23.) That <hi>the Raven found a Carcaſe of a Man upon a Mountain, and ſo would return no more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the next words (which in the <hi>Greek</hi> and
<hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> are both alike) confute this Tranſlation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntil the Waters were dried up from the Earth.</hi>] Which make this plain and eaſie Sence, in connexion with the foregoing, (as they run in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi>) that while the Earth continued covered with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Raven often flew from the Ark, but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no convenient place to reſt in, returned thither again: Till the Ground was dry. Whereas, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Greek,</hi> we muſt ſuppoſe the Raven to have returned to the Ark, when the Waters were dried up from the Ground. Which is very abſurd: For, if it had ſome time ſat upon a Carcaſe floating in the Waters, before they were dried up, or upon the <pb n="149" facs="tcp:50230:81"/> top of ſome Mountain which already appeared; what ſhould make it return when all the Waters were gone every where, and not rather while they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained upon the Ground?</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>Alſo he ſent forth a Dove.</hi>] As a proper Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to make further Diſcoveries: Being of a ſtrong flight, loving to ſeed upon the Ground, and pick up Seeds; and conſtantly returning to its reſt, from the remoteſt places. Theſe two Birds, (the <hi>Raven</hi> and the <hi>Dove,</hi>) ſome imagine were ſent forth upon one and the ſame Day, or but a Day between; as <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chartus</hi> conjectures. But this doth not agree with <hi>Verſe</hi> 10. where it is ſaid, <hi>Noah ſtayed yet other ſeven Days,</hi> and then ſent out the Dove again: Which relates to ſeven Days preceding; which ſeem to have paſſed between the ſending out of the <hi>Raven</hi> and of the <hi>Dove.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>The Dove found no reſt,</hi> &amp;c.] For, though the tops of the Mountains appeared, yet they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued muddy, as ſome conceive; or, they were ſo far off, that the Dove could not eaſily reach them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>And he ſtaid yet other ſeven Days.</hi>] It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by this, that on the <hi>ſeventh</hi> Day, <hi>Noah</hi> expected a Bleſſing rather than on another Day: It being the Day devoted from the beginning to Religious Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices. Which he having (it is likely) performed, thereupon ſent out the Dove upon this Day, as he had done before, with hope of good Tidings.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>And, lo, in her Mouth was an Olive-Leaf,</hi> (or
<hi>Branch</hi> the word ſignifies) <hi>pluckt off.</hi>] <hi>Bochart</hi> thinks the Dove brought this out of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> which abounds with Olive-Trees, and lay <hi>South</hi> of <hi>Ararat;</hi> the Wind then blowing towards that Country from the <hi>North.</hi> (See <hi>Hierozoic. L.</hi> I.
<hi>c.</hi> 6. <hi>p.</hi> 2.) where he ſhows out <pb n="150" facs="tcp:50230:82"/> of many Authors, that not only <hi>Olive-Trees,</hi> but ſome other alſo, will live and be green under Water. All the difficulty is, how the Dove could break off a Branch (as the <hi>Vulgar</hi> tranſlates it) from the Tree. But it is eaſily ſolved, if we allow, as I have ſaid before, that now it was Summer-time; which brought new Shoots out of the Trees, that were eaſily cropt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So he knew the Waters were abated.</hi>] The tops of Mountains were ſeen before, <hi>verſe</hi> 5. but now he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the Waters had left the lower Grounds. Yet not ſo left them that the Dove would ſtay; the Earth, it is likely, remaining very chill.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>And he ſtaid yet other ſeven Days.</hi>] See
<hi>Verſe</hi> 10. The Obſervation there, being confirm'd by what is repeated here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Returned not again to him any more.</hi>] There want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neither Food, nor a Neſt wherein to repoſe it ſelf. By which
<hi>Noah</hi> underſtood, the Earth was not only dry, and fit to be inhabited: But that it was not quite ſpoiled by the Flood, but would afford Food for all Creatures.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>Noah removed the covering of the Ark.</hi>] Some of the Boards on the top. For he could ſee further by looking out there, than if he look'd out at the Door, or the Window, which gave him a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect but one way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The face of the Ground was dry.</hi>] Quite freed from Water, but yet ſo ſoft and muddy, that it was not fit to be inhabited: As appears by his ſtaying ſtill, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt two Months more, before he thought fit to go out. So the following <hi>Verſe</hi> tells us.</p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>In the ſecond Month,</hi> &amp;c.] If their Months were ſuch as ours, twelve of which make <hi>Three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:50230:82"/> ſixty five</hi> Days, then <hi>Noah</hi> ſtaid in the Ark a whole Year and ten Days, as appears by comparing this <hi>Verſe</hi> with VII. 11. But if they were Lunar Months, which is moſt probable, then he was in the Ark juſt one of our Years: Going out on the <hi>Three hundred and ſixty fifth</hi> Day after his entrance into it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Was the Earth dried.</hi>] Perfectly dried, ſo that no moiſture remained; and Graſs, it is likely, was ſprung up for the Cattle.</p>
               <p>It need not ſeem a wonder, that <hi>Moſes</hi> gives ſo punctual and particular an Account of this whole matter, and of all that follows; for he lived within <hi>Eight hundred</hi> Years of the Flood: And therefore might very well know what had been done within that Period, and eaſily tell how the World was peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled by the Poſterity of <hi>Noah.</hi> Which could not but be freſh in memory, when Men lived ſo long; that not much above <hi>three</hi> Generations had paſſed, from the Flood to
<hi>Moſes.</hi> For <hi>Shem,</hi> who ſaw the Flood was contemporary with
<hi>Abraham;</hi> as he was with <hi>Jacob;</hi> whoſe great Grand-Child was the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>Go forth out of the Ark.</hi>] Though he ſaw the Earth was fit to be inhabited; yet he waited for God's Order to go out of the Ark, as he had it for his entring into it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thou and thy Wife,</hi> &amp;c.] I do not think the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome of the <hi>Jews</hi> is abſurd; who by comparing this <hi>Verſe</hi> with VII. 13. make this Collection: That while they were in the Ark, the Men did not coha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit with their Wives; it being a time of great Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction: And therefore they kept aſunder in ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Apartments. So
<hi>R. Elieſer</hi> in his <hi>Pirke, Cap.</hi> XXIII. where <hi>R. Levitas</hi> thus gathers it: When they went <pb n="152" facs="tcp:50230:83"/> into the Ark it is ſaid, VII. 13. <hi>Noah and his Sons en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,</hi> and then <hi>Noah's Wife,</hi> and <hi>his Sons Wives:</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, ſaith he, here the Men are put together, and the Women together. But when they come out it is here ſaid,
<hi>Go forth, thou and thy Wife, and thy Sons, and thy Sons Wives, with thee;</hi> lo, here they are cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled together, as before they were ſeparated. And ſo we find them again, <hi>verſe</hi> 18. where it is ſaid, <hi>Noah went forth and his Wife,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>Bring forth every living Creature,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>that they may breed,</hi> &amp;c.] One would think, by this, that no Creature bred in the Ark, no more than Men: But now are ſent forth to breed and multiply in the Earth.</p>
               <p>Ver. 20. <hi>And Noah built an Altar to the LORD.</hi>] We never read of any built before this time: Though we may reaſonably conclude there was an Altar upon which <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> offered; in the place appointed for Divine Worſhip.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Offered burnt-offerings.</hi>] He reſtores the ancient Rite of Divine Service; which his Sons and their Poſterity followed. Some think theſe <hi>Burnt-Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> had ſomething in them of the Nature of a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory</hi> Sacrifice, as well as <hi>Euchariſtical,</hi> which they certainly were for their Deliverance from the Flood. Their Reaſon is taken from what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
               <p>Ver. 21. <hi>The LORD ſmelled a ſweet ſavour.</hi>] That is, as <hi>Munſter</hi> underſtands it, he ceaſed from his Anger and was appeaſed. So the <hi>Syriack</hi> alſo, and <hi>Joſephus, L.</hi> I.
<hi>Antiq. c.</hi> 4. But it may ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie no more, but that his Thankfulneſs was as grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to God, as ſweet Odors are to us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:50230:83"/>
                  <hi>And the LORD ſaid in his Heart.</hi>] He determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or reſolved in himſelf. The <hi>Vulgar</hi> underſtands this, as if the LORD ſpake comfortably to <hi>Noah,</hi> (which in the
<hi>Hebrew</hi> Phraſe is, <hi>ſpeaking to ones Heart</hi>) and ſaid,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will not again curſe the Ground any more.</hi>] <hi>i. e.</hi> After this manner, with a Deluge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For the imagination of Man's Heart is evil from his Youth.</hi>] Such a proclivity there is in Men to evil, that if I ſhould ſcourge them thus, as often as they deſerve, there would be no end of Deluges. But the Words may have a quite different ſence, being connected with what went before in this manner; <hi>I will not curſe the Ground any more for Man's ſake; tho' he be ſo very evilly diſpoſed,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Words, <hi>from his Youth,</hi> ſignify a long radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated corruption, as appears from many places, <hi>Iſa.</hi> XLVII. 12,

               </p>
               <p>Ver. 22. <hi>While the Earth remaineth.</hi>] While Men ſhall inhabit the Earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seed-time and Harveſt,</hi> &amp;c.] There ſhall not be ſuch a Year as this laſt has been: In which there was neither Sowing nor Reaping; nor any diſtinctions of Seaſons, 'till the Rain was done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Day and Night ſhall not ceaſe.</hi>] One would think by this expreſſion, that the Day did not much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from Night; while the Heavens were covered with thick Clouds, which fell in diſmal Floods of Rain.</p>

               <p>Ver. 1. <hi>AND God bleſſed Noah and his Sons,</hi> &amp;c.] The Divine Majeſty appeared now to <hi>Noah</hi> and his Sons; to aſſure them of his Favour and Protection; and to renew the bleſſing beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Adam</hi> (as after a new Creation) ſaying, <hi>Increaſe and Multiply.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>The fear of you,</hi> &amp;c.] He ſeems alſo to confirm to them, the Dominion which God gave to <hi>Adam,</hi> at firſt, over all Creatures. I. 26.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>Every moving thing that liveth ſhall be meat for you,</hi> &amp;c.] Here the firſt Grant made to Mankind concerning Food, is enlarged, as St. <hi>Baſil</hi> obſerves,
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, The firſt Legiſlation granted to them the uſe of Fruits; but now of all living Creatures; which they are as free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly permitted to eat of, as formerly of all the Fruits of the Garden.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, He conceded to them the enjoyment of all things. This is the general fence of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and of the <hi>Chriſtian Fathers,</hi> and of the firſt <hi>Reformers</hi> of Religion. They that would have this only a renewal of ſuch an old Charter, are of later ſtanding; and can ſhew us no Charter, but are led by ſome reaſonings of their own, not by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: Unleſs we will admit ſuch a Criticiſm upon <hi>Gen.</hi> I. 30. as ſeems to me very forced. And they would have this alſo underſtood only of clean Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: But I do not find any Ground for the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction <pb n="155" facs="tcp:50230:84"/> of Clean and Unclean Creatures, with reſpect to <hi>Food,</hi> but only to <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> as was ſaid before.</p>
               <p>The reaſon why God now granted the liberty to eat Fleſh,
<hi>Abarbinel</hi> thinks was, becauſe otherwiſe there would not have been Food enough for <hi>Noah</hi> and his Sons: The Fruits of the Earth which before were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant, being all deſtroyed; ſo that for the preſent there was not ſufficient for their ſuſtenance. Others think the reaſon of it was, becauſe the Fruits of the Earth, were not now ſo nutritive as they had been, before the ſalt water of the Sea very much ſpoiled the Soil.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>But fleſh with the life thereof,</hi> &amp;c.] Here is one exception to the foregoing large Grant, that the Blood of Beaſts ſhould not be eaten: Juſt as at the firſt, one Fruit in the midſt of the Garden was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, when all the reſt were allowed. The
<hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Doctors generally underſtand this to be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition to cut off any Limb of a living Creature, and to eat it while the Life, that is, the Blood was in it: <hi>Dum adhuc vivit, &amp; palpitat, ſeu tremit,</hi> as a modern Interpreter truly repreſents their ſence. Which is followed by many Chriſtians. See <hi>Mercer, Muſculus,</hi> eſpecially Mr.
<hi>Selden, L.</hi> VII. <hi>c.</hi> 1. <hi>de Jure N. &amp; G.</hi> Who think, as <hi>Maimonides</hi> doth, that there were ſome People in the old World ſo fierce and barbarous, that they eat raw Fleſh, while it was yet warm from the Beaſt out of whoſe Body it was cut: And he makes this to have been a part of their Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Worſhip. (See <hi>More Nevochim, Par.</hi> III.
<hi>c.</hi> 48.) But, ſuppoſing this to be true, there were ſo few of theſe People, we may well think, (for he himſelf ſaith, it was the Cuſtom of the <hi>Gentile</hi> Kings to do thus) that there needed not to have been a Precept <pb n="156" facs="tcp:50230:85"/> given to all Mankind, to avoid that, unto which Humane Nature is of it ſelf averſe.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> therefore expounds this, of not eating <hi>things Strangled:</hi> And <hi>L. de Dieu</hi> of not eating
<hi>that which died of it ſelf:</hi> For <hi>Nepheſh</hi> in Scripture ſignifies ſometime a dead Carkaſe. But it is manifeſt, it was not unlawful for all People to eat ſuch things; for God himſelf orders the
<hi>Iſraelites,</hi> to give that which died of it ſelf to a Stranger, or to ſell it to an Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, <hi>Deut.</hi> XIV. 21. And therefore the ſimpleſt ſence ſeems to be, that they ſhould not eat the Blood of any Creature: Which was a poſitive Precept, like that of not eating of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. And the reaſon of it, perhaps, was, that God intending in after-times to reſerve the Blood, for the expiation of Sin, required this early abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence from it, that they might be the better prepared to ſubmit to that Law, and underſtand the reaſon of it: Which was, that it was the <hi>Life of the Beaſt,</hi> which God accepted inſtead of their Life, when they had forfeited it by their Sins.</p>
               <p>And there is another plain reaſon given of this Prohibition, immediately after it; that they might be the more fearful of ſheding the Blood one of another; when it was not lawful ſo much as to taſte the Blood of a Beaſt.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>And ſurely.</hi>] Or rather, <hi>for ſurely,</hi> as the LXX, the <hi>vulgar Latin,</hi> and a great number of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Men, expound the particle <hi>Van</hi> as a <hi>Cauſal,</hi> not as a <hi>Copulative</hi> in this place. So that the ſence is this: Therefore I command you to abſtain from the Blood of living Creatures, that you may he the farther off from ſheding the Blood of Men. For that is ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in my account, that I will take care he be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely <pb n="157" facs="tcp:50230:85"/> puniſhed, by whom it is ſhed; yea, the very Beaſt ſhall die that kills a Man. So it follows,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>At the hand of every Beaſt will I require it.</hi>] Not as if Beaſts were to blame, if they killed a Man; (for they are capable neither of Vice nor Vertue) but this was ordained with reſpect to Men, for whoſe uſe Beaſts were created. For, <hi>Firſt,</hi> ſuch owners as were not careful to prevent ſuch miſchiefs were hereby pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed: And,
<hi>Secondly,</hi> others were admoniſhed by their example to be cautious: And, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> God hereby inſtructed them that Murder was a moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Crime, whoſe puniſhment extended even to Beaſts. And
<hi>Laſtly,</hi> the Lives of Men were hereby much ſecured, by the killing ſuch Beaſts, as might otherways have done the like miſchief hereafter. See <hi>Bochart</hi> in his <hi>Hierozoic. P.</hi> I. <hi>L.</hi> I.
<hi>c.</hi> 40.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>At the hand of every Man's Brother,</hi> &amp;c.] And therefore much more will I require it at the Hand of every Man. Whom he calls
<hi>Brother,</hi> to ſhow that Murder is the more heinous upon this account; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are all <hi>Brethren.</hi> Or the meaning may be, (as ſome will have it) that though he be as nearly related as a Brother, he ſhall not go unpuniſhed.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>Whoſo ſheds Man's Blood.</hi>] He repeats it over again, to enact this Law more ſtrongly. Or, as the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> underſtand it, he ſpake before of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he would inflict himſelf upon the Murderer; and now of the care we ſhould take to puniſh it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By Man ſhall his Blood be ſhed.</hi>] That is, by the Magiſtrate or Judges. For God had kept the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of Murder in his own Hand 'till now; as we may gather from the ſtory of <hi>Cain,</hi> whom he ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, but ſuffered no Body to kill him. But here gives authority to Judges to call every body to an <pb n="158" facs="tcp:50230:86"/> account for it, and put them to death. They that would ſee more of the Senſe of the <hi>Jews</hi> about theſe and the foregoing words, may read Mr. <hi>Selden de Jure N. &amp; G. L.</hi> I. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. and <hi>L.</hi> IV. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. and <hi>de Synedriis, L.</hi> I. <hi>cap.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>I will only add, that they rightly conclude, that as Courts of Judicature were hereby authorized; ſo what was thus ordained againſt Murder, by a parity of reaſon, was to be executed upon other great. Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders; there being ſome things which are no leſs dear to us than Life; as Virginal Chaſtity, and Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Fidelity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For in the Image of God made he Man.</hi>] Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Sin of Man, there remained ſo much of the Image of God in him, as intitled him to his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar protection.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>And ye, be ye fruitful,</hi> &amp;c.] You need not doubt therefore of the bleſſing I now beſtowed upon you, (<hi>Verſe</hi> 1.) for you ſee what care I take of the preſervation, as well as the propagation of Mankind.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>I will eſtabliſh my Covenant with you.</hi>] Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Beaſts cannot Covenant, moſt underſtand by that Word ſimply a Promiſe; as <hi>Jer.</hi> XXXIII. 25. But there is no need of this explication; the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant being made directly with <hi>Noah,</hi> including all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Creatures, who were to have the benefit of it.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>From all that go out of the Ark, to every Beaſt of the Earth.</hi>] That is, it ſhall extend not only to thoſe which now go out of the Ark; but to all their breed in future Ages.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>And I will eſtabliſh my Covenant with you,</hi> &amp;c.] Doubt not of it; for I tell you again, I I will faithfully keep this ſolemn promiſe.</p>

               <p>Ver 12. <hi>And the LORD ſaid, This is the Token of the Covenant,</hi> &amp;c.] I do not only give you my Word; but a Token or Sign that I will keep it.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>I do ſet my Bow in the Clouds,</hi> &amp;c.] Moſt think this doth not ſignifie there never had been a Rain-bow before the Flood; for ſince there was both Sun and Clouds, it is likely, ſay they, there was a Rain-bow alſo: Only now it was appointed for a <hi>Sign,</hi> which it was not before. But as this Opinion hath nothing in Scripture to enforce it, ſo grounds in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture there are none to warrant it; unleſs we will aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert this manifeſt untruth, That every diſpoſition of the Air, or every Cloud is fitly diſpoſed to produce a Rain-bow. They are the words of that great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, Dr. <hi>Jackson</hi> (Book I. upon the <hi>Creed, c.</hi> 16.) who adds, that if other Natural Cauſes, with their motions and diſpoſitions depend upon the final (as Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture Philoſophy teaches us) they who acknowledge the Scripture, have no reaſon to think that either the Clouds or the Air had that peculiar diſpoſition before the Flood, which is required to the production of the Rain-bow: When this wonderful effect had no ſuch uſe or end, as it hath had ever ſince. For it was appointed by God, to be a witneſs of his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with the new World; a Meſſenger to ſecure Mankind from deſtruction by Deluges. Now if it had appeared before the Flood, the ſight of it after the Flood would have been but a poor comfort to <hi>Noah</hi> and his timorous Poſterity: Whoſe fear leaſt the like Inundation might happen again, was greater than could be taken away by a common or uſual <pb n="160" facs="tcp:50230:87"/> Sign. The ancient <hi>Poets</hi> had a better Philoſophy (though they knew not the original of it) when they feigned
<hi>Iris</hi> to be the Daughter, or (as we would now ſpeak) <hi>the Mother of wonderment</hi> (<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

               <p>
                  <hi>That the Bow ſhall be ſeen in the Cloud.</hi>] Not alway, but at certain times; often enough to put Men in mind of this promiſe, and ſtir up their belief of it. For it doth as it were ſay, I will not drown the Earth again, though the Clouds have thickned as if they threatned it. Common Philoſophy teaches us, that the <hi>Rain-bow</hi> is a natural ſign there will not be much Rain after it appears; but that the Clouds begin to diſperſe. For it is never made in a thick Cloud, but in a thin: So that if it appear after Showers, which come from thick Clouds, it is a token that now they grow thin. But the God of Nature choſe this to be a ſign, that he would never thicken again to ſuch a degree to bring a Deluge upon the Earth.

<hi>Moſes</hi> his Commentary upon it, we may ſee in the mixt Colours of the Rain-bow, theſe two things; <hi>the deſtruction of the old World by Water,</hi> and the <hi>future conſumption of the preſent World by Fire;</hi> whoſe flaming brightneſs is predominant in the wateriſh Humour.</p>
               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>And I will remember my Covenant,</hi> &amp;c.] Look upon it as a Token of my faithfulneſs to my Word.</p>
               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>I will look upon it, that I may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> &amp;c.] This is ſpoken after the manner of Men; the more to confirm their belief, that God would not go back with his Word.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>And Ham is the Father of Canaan.</hi>] This Son of
<hi>Ham</hi> is here alone mentioned, becauſe he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the following wicked Fact of his Father: And his Poſterity were thoſe wicked People whoſe Country God gave to the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi>

               <p>Ver. 19. <hi>And of them was the whole Earth over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread.</hi>] By this it appears, that though <hi>Noah</hi> lived above Three hundred years after he came out of the Ark, yet begat no more Children; or if he did, none of them lived to have any poſterity.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>And he planted a Vineyard.</hi>] There were <hi>Vines</hi> here and there before the Flood; but <hi>Noah</hi> ſeems to have been the firſt that made a <hi>Vineyard,</hi> and put them in order. And the firſt, perhaps, that invented <hi>Wine-Preſſes,</hi> to preſs out the Juice of the Grapes, and make Wine. If he was not the inventer of theſe two, (<hi>planting of Vineyards,</hi> and <hi>making Wine</hi>) yet we may well allow him to be the improver of them, as he was of Husbandry.</p>
               <p>Ver. 21. <hi>And he drank of the Wine, and was drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</hi>] Being unacquainted with the ſtrength of the Liquor, (as ſeveral of the
<hi>Fathers,</hi> as well as of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors, think) or elſe being old and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to bear its ſtrength: As <hi>Epiphanius</hi> underſtands it. See <hi>Haereſ.</hi> LXIII. <hi>n.</hi> 3. For it is manifeſt, from what follows, that this hapned a great while after the Flood;
<hi>Ham</hi> having a Son; nay more than one, for <hi>Canaan</hi> was not his firſt-born.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he was uncovered in his Tent.</hi>] The heat of the Weather, or of the Wine, perhaps, made him throw off the Clothes: Or he was negligent being not himſelf.</p>
               <p>Ver. 22. <hi>And Ham the Father of Canaan,</hi> &amp;c.] There are ſome circumſtances, which follow, that make the Opinion of the
<hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors not improbable; that <hi>Canaan</hi> firſt ſaw
<hi>Noah</hi> in this indecent poſture, <pb n="163" facs="tcp:50230:88"/> and made ſport with it to his Father: Who was ſo far from reproving him, as he ought to have done, that he alſo did the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And told his two Brethren without.</hi>] In the Street, publickly before the People, he proclaimed his Father's ſhame, and mock'd at it. For it is hard to think that God curſed him meerly for his irreverence, but there was ſomething of deriſion joyned with it, and perhaps of prophaneneſs and irreligion: in laughing (we may conceive) at the promiſe of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> which, it is likely, he heard his Father often ſpeak of; but now thought him incapable to beget. For <hi>Ham</hi> is generally thought to have been an impious Man; and ſome take him to have been the firſt inventor of Idols after the Flood; nay, of Magick, which he learnt of the wicked <hi>Cainites</hi> before the Flood. Thus <hi>Gaſpar Schottus, L.</hi> I. <hi>de Magia, cap.</hi> 3. <hi>prolegom.</hi> Where he endeavours to ſhow he was the ſame with him whom the <hi>Perſians</hi> call

               </p>
               <p>Ver. 23. <hi>And Shem and Japhet took a Garment,</hi> &amp;c.] A great argument of their Piety, and dutiful affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to their Father; which God therefore greatly rewarded.</p>
               <p>Ver. 24. <hi>And knew what his younger Son had done.</hi>] Finding himſelf covered with Clothes that were not his own, he enquired, it is likely, how it came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout: And was informed how he had been abuſed by one of his Sons, and honoured by the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His younger Son.</hi>] Some make this an Argument that
<hi>Canaan</hi> was the firſt made himſelf merry with his Grandfather: And is here called his <hi>younger</hi> or <hi>little</hi> Son (nothing being more common than to call thoſe the Sons of another, who were his Grand-Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as Couſin-Germans are called Brothers) for <hi>Ham</hi> 
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:50230:89"/> was neither <hi>little,</hi> nor his <hi>younger</hi> Son; but the middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, as he is always placed. Nor doth it ſeem at all pertinent to the matter, to mention the Order of his birth; but very fit, if he ſpake of his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to diſtinguiſh him from the reſt. And what follows is a farther proof of it.</p>
               <p>Ver. 25. <hi>Curſed be Canaan,</hi> &amp;c.] If what I ſaid before, (<hi>verſe</hi> 22, 24,) be allowed, it makes it eaſie to give an account why <hi>Canaan</hi> is curſed rather than <hi>Ham;</hi> becauſe he was firſt guilty. <hi>Ham</hi> indeed was puniſhed in him: But he had other Sons, on whom the puniſhment did not fall, but only on this. For which I can find no reaſon ſo probable as that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore named. Which if it be not allowed, we muſt have recourſe to an harſh interpretation; and by

               <p>Ver. 26. <hi>Bleſſed be the LORD God of Shem.</hi>] The LORD, was the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Shem,</hi> after a peculiar manner, juſt as he was the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the gracious Covenant made with him: For God ſetled his Church in the Family of <hi>Shem;</hi> and Chriſt was born of his poſterity; and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in all likelyhood, kept up the Worſhip of the true God, and oppoſed Idolatry. In ſhort, to be the <hi>God of Shem,</hi> was to beſtow all manner of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings upon him; which <hi>Noah</hi> here propheſies to him, by <hi>bleſſing</hi> the LORD for them: Whom he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges to be the Author of them, out of his ſpecial grace and favour towards him. For he was the younger Brother of

Which the <hi>Hebrews</hi> uſe (as Mr.
<hi>Mede</hi> hath obſerved) to ſignifie, <hi>all thoſe Countries divided from them by the Sea;</hi> or, ſuch as they uſed not to go to, but by Sea. See <hi>Book</hi> I. <hi>Diſc.</hi> 47. Many places teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie this,
<hi>Iſai.</hi> XI. 10, 11. XL. 15. <hi>Jer.</hi> II. 10, &amp;c. Now if
<hi>Moſes</hi> wrote this Book in <hi>Egypt,</hi> (as he thinks it probable,) they commonly went from thence to <hi>Phrygia, Cappadocia, Paphlagonia</hi> by Sea, as well as to <hi>Greece, Italy,</hi> &amp;c. To <hi>Media</hi> indeed, he thinks, they did not uſe to go by Sea, and therefore makes this an Objection againſt <hi>Madai</hi> being the Father of the <hi>Medes:</hi> For their Country cannot be called an <hi>Iſle.</hi> But the far greater part of the Regions, peopled by the Sons of <hi>Japhet,</hi> being ſuch as he confeſſes the <hi>Hebrews</hi> call <hi>Iſles, Moſes</hi> might well ſay, the <hi>Iſles of the Gentiles</hi> were parted among them, though
<hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> be comprehended which was not ſuch an <hi>Iſle.</hi> But there is no need of all this, if we take the word we tranſlate
<hi>Iſle,</hi> for a Region, Country, or Province. And ſo it plainly ſignifies, <hi>Job</hi> XXII. 30. <hi>Iſai.</hi> XX. 6. where, in the Margin, we tranſlate it <hi>Country.</hi> And then the word <hi>Goim,</hi> which we render <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a <hi>multitude of People;</hi> as it doth often in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: Particularly <hi>Gen.</hi> XVII. 4, 16.

<hi>Verſe;</hi> and in the laſt Clauſe of this <hi>Chapter; by theſe</hi> were the [<hi>Goim</hi>] <hi>Nations</hi> divided in the Earth. Which may ſerve to explain this Phraſe here; which we may thus interpret,
<hi>by theſe,</hi> or among theſe, <hi>were divided the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of the People</hi> or <hi>Nations</hi> (deſcended from <hi>Japhet</hi>) <hi>in their Lands;</hi> in the ſeveral Countries which they poſſeſſed.</p>

                  <hi>Divided.</hi>] It appears by the following words, (according to his <hi>Language, Family,</hi> and
<hi>Nation,</hi>) this great Diviſion of the Earth was made <hi>orderly;</hi> and not by a <hi>confuſed</hi> irregular Diſperſion, wherein eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one went whither he liſted, and ſeated himſelf where he thought good. This Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> thinks is alſo ſuggeſted in the very word we tranſlate <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided:</hi> Which ſignifies not a ſcattered, but a diſtinct Partition.</p>

<hi>Jonathan</hi> is rather to be followed, who here Paraphraſes it
<hi>Arabia.</hi> For <hi>Cuſh</hi> is the ſame with <hi>Chuſan,</hi> (only this latter is a diminutive,) which is made the ſame with <hi>Midian, Habak.</hi> III. 7. And ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> his Wife is called a

<hi>Ezek.</hi> XXIX. 10. that <hi>Cuſh</hi> cannot be <hi>Aethiopia;</hi> for, when God ſaith he will make <hi>Egypt</hi> deſolate, <hi>from the tower of Syene, to the border of Cuſh,</hi> if we ſhould underſtand by
<hi>Cuſh</hi> the Country of <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> it will be as if he had ſaid, <hi>from Aethiopia to Aethiopia.</hi> For every one

<hi>Phaleg, c.</hi> 26. For it appears by <hi>Diodorus</hi> that they were near of kin; having many things common to both Nations; which <pb n="194" facs="tcp:50230:105"/> he reckons up, and are ſufficient to perſuade thoſe who conſider them, that they had the ſame Original: The only difference among them, being this; which of them was of greateſt Antiquity. The <hi>Egyptians</hi> fanſied they were the firſt of all Men; and the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopians</hi> pretended that they living more <hi>Southerly,</hi> had a ſtronger Sun; which contributed more effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly to natural Generation: And that <hi>Egypt</hi> was a Country thrown up by the Mudd which <hi>Nilus</hi> left, and ſo got out of the Sea. But <hi>Moſes</hi> hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined this Controverſie in theſe words, and by the reſt of his Hiſtory. Which ſhows that the firſt Men after the Flood, came from the Mountains of <hi>Armenia,</hi> which is in the
<hi>North;</hi> and conſequently they went to the <hi>Southerly</hi> Countries by degrees, through <hi>Aſſyria, Babylon, Syria,</hi> and

<hi>Egypt:</hi> And the Opinion of <hi>Bochartus</hi> is probable that they are the <hi>Nomades,</hi> who lived about <hi>Ammon</hi> and

<hi>Herodotus</hi> tells us, and lived upon them, (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they abſtained from eating <hi>Cows</hi> or <hi>Swine,</hi>) and their Garments alſo, as he tells us, were of Sheep-Skins.</p>

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Bochart</hi> with great reaſon thinks the

               <p>There was a City called <hi>Nepata</hi> by <hi>Pliny,</hi> which

Bochart</hi> hath brought a great many Arguments to prove this: Particularly from <hi>Ezekiel</hi> XXIX. 14. which ſhows clearly that <hi>Pathros</hi> belongs to <hi>Egypt:</hi> For the Prophet foretelling that God would bring again the Captivity of <hi>Egypt,</hi> he ſaith he would <hi>cauſe them to return into the Land of Pathros, into the Land of their Habitation,</hi> or <hi>Nativity:</hi> That is, into
<hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bais,</hi> which <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> had principally afflicted, carrying moſt of the Inhabitants of <hi>Thebes</hi> into Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity.

               <p>
                  <hi>And Caphtorim.</hi>] Theſe were a People near to

All the Ancients therefore are in the right, who take the <hi>Caphtorim,</hi> for the <hi>Cappadocians:</hi> Yet, not all the Inhabitants of that Country, (part of which was poſſeſſed by other People, as was ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,) but that part of <hi>Cappadocia</hi> which was next to <hi>Colchis, viz.</hi> About <hi>Trapezund,</hi> where <hi>Colchis</hi> end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For there we find the City called <hi>Side,</hi> and the Country <hi>Sidene,</hi> mentioned by

<hi>Hebrew,</hi> viz. <hi>Malum punicum:</hi> And therefore in all likelihood, the ſame Country was called by the Hebrews <hi>Caphtor,</hi> and by the Greeks <hi>Sidene.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What invited the <hi>Caphtorim</hi> out of <hi>Egypt</hi> into this Country, is hard to tell, at this diſtance of time. But <hi>Strabo</hi> thinks it was the Fame of the Gold, wherewith this Country abounded. And as this drew them thither, ſo perhaps the coldneſs of the Country, very much different from that wherein they were born; or elſe their Neighbours the

And in their way through <hi>Paleſtine</hi> they fell upon the <hi>Avim,</hi> whom they diſpoſſeſſed of their Country, and ſetled there, (<hi>Deut.</hi> II. 23.) by the Name of <hi>Philiſtim.</hi>

<hi>Fiſhing</hi> or <hi>Fiſhery:</hi> As the Town in <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee</hi> called <hi>Bethſaida,</hi> is as much as the <hi>place of Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> For that Sea upon which it lies, the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſay, abounded with Fiſh. However the <hi>Sidonians</hi> came from this Son of <hi>Canaan;</hi> and ſome of them, (if he did not found it himſelf,) called the City by this Name, in memory of him. It was far more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and famous than <hi>Tyre:</hi> For we read of it in the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and the <hi>Judges:</hi> But nothing of <hi>Tyre</hi> till the Days of

<hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabians</hi> (in the <hi>Nubian</hi> Geographer) <hi>Hama.</hi> This is the City which is meant when we ſo often read that the bounds of
<hi>Judaea</hi> were to the <hi>Entrance of Hamath,</hi> Northward,
<hi>Numb.</hi> XIII. 21. XXXIV. 8. and other places. For it is certain they did not reach to <hi>Antiochia,</hi> but came near to <hi>Epiphania.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Afterwards were the Families of the Canaanites ſpread abroad.</hi>] In proceſs of time they enlarged their bounds: For they poſſeſſed all the Country, which lies from <hi>Idumaea</hi> and
<hi>Paleſtine,</hi> to the mouth of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rontes:</hi> Which they held for
<hi>Seven hundred</hi> Years, or thereabout. <hi>Moſes</hi> indeed confines the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> in narrower bounds toward the <hi>North,</hi> (as hath been ſaid) but we muſt conſider that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes only that part of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which God gave to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> for their Portion. Now there being <hi>Eleven</hi> Nations who had their Original (as appears from this and the foregoing Verſes) from ſo many Sons of
<hi>Canaan;</hi> we do not find that the <hi>Firſt,</hi> and the

<hi>Lions, Bears, Wolves, Foxes,</hi> and ſuch-like Creatures ſhould get thither: For none, ſure, would carry them by Shipping, though Men themſelves might, by that means, paſs over into thoſe Regions. But this difficulty is not ſo great as they make it. For it is manifeſt, That though the Continent of <hi>America</hi> was found full of ſuch Beaſts, when the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> firſt came thither, yet none of the Iſlands, though very large, which lay remote from the Land, had any <hi>Lions, Tygers,</hi> or ſuch-like Creatures in them. Which is a demonſtration, that theſe Creatures, were not originally from that part of the Earth; for then the Iſlands would have been furniſhed with them, as well as the Continent; juſt as they are with all ſorts of Vegetables: And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Continent it ſelf was ſtored with theſe Creatures from ſome other part of the Earth. Which might be done by ſome Neck of Land not yet diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; which joyns ſome part of <hi>Europe,</hi> or <hi>Aſia,</hi> to the Continent of <hi>America.</hi> Or, if there be no ſuch Neck of Land now extant, yet there may have been ſuch a Bridge (as we may call it) between the

And truly, he that obſerves (as that great Man the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Hales</hi> ſpeaks, in his Book of the

<hi>Heathens</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves acknowledge there was but one Language an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently, (ſee <hi>Joſephus,</hi> and out of him <hi>Euſebius, L.</hi> IX. <hi>Praep. Evang. c.</hi> 14, 15.) which in all likelihood, was the ſame that had been from the Beginning, which <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf ſpake. For
<hi>Methuſelah,</hi> the Grand-Father of <hi>Noah,</hi> lived ſome time with him, and ſpake, we may well ſuppoſe, the ſame Language that he did. And we cannot but think the ſame of <hi>Noah:</hi> Who propagated it among his Poſterity till this time. But whether this was the <hi>Hebrew</hi> or no, we cannot be <pb n="219" facs="tcp:50230:117"/> certain. The <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſts, and the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Writers generally ſay it was; and moſt Chriſtian Writers have been of their Opinion: In ſo much that <hi>R. Gedalian,</hi> upon theſe words, ſaith; <hi>The wiſe Men among the Chriſtians have ſearched what was the firſt Tongue; and all the World confeſſes that from</hi> Adam <hi>to the Flood they ſpake the Holy Language.</hi> Which it is not to be thought, we have now intire and pure; but that a conſiderable part of it ſtill remains in the <hi>Bible.</hi> As may be proved by no contemptible Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; particularly this, that <hi>Shem</hi> the Son of <hi>Noah,</hi> was for ſome time contemporary with
<hi>Abraham,</hi> who deſcended from him; and in whoſe Family conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued the ſame Language which they both ſpake, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Moſes</hi> his days.</p>
               <p>They that have fanſied there were more Languages than one, at this time, grounded their miſtake upon thoſe words, <hi>Gen.</hi> X. 5, 20,
31. where the Sons of <hi>Noah</hi> are ſaid to have had the Earth divided among them, <hi>according to their Tongues.</hi> Not conſidering, that he ſpeaks of this very Diviſion, of which he is going to give an account; and briefly mentioned there, <hi>verſe</hi> 25. For the <hi>thirteen</hi> Sons of
<hi>Joktan,</hi> immediately after mentioned, (who had their ſhare in the diviſion,) were not in being, when their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle <hi>Peleg</hi> was born; as the moſt learned Primate <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> hath demonſtrated in his
<hi>Annals, A. M.</hi> 1757.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>As they journeyed from the Eaſt.</hi>] He doth not ſpeak of all the Poſterity of <hi>Noah,</hi> who after the Flood planted in the <hi>Eaſt;</hi> much leſs <hi>Noah</hi> himſelf: But of a great Colony of them, who when the <hi>Eaſt</hi> was much peopled, choſe to go
<hi>Weſtward.</hi> By <hi>the Eaſt,</hi> moſt underſtand
<hi>Armenia,</hi> where they ſuppoſe the Ark reſted, and <hi>Noah</hi> with his Sons planted. But <pb n="220" facs="tcp:50230:118"/> this hath great difficulty in it, for the Mountains of <hi>Armenia</hi> lay <hi>North</hi> of
<hi>Shinar,</hi> or <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and not <hi>Eaſt.</hi> Which
<hi>Bochart</hi> ſolves in this manner: <hi>Aſſyria</hi> being divided into two parts; one on this ſide, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the further ſide of
<hi>Tigris,</hi> they called all that part beyond <hi>Tigris,</hi> the
<hi>Eaſt</hi> Country; though a great part of it towards <hi>Armenia</hi> was really <hi>Northward;</hi> and that part on this ſide they called
<hi>Weſt,</hi> though ſome of it lay to the <hi>South, L.</hi> I.
<hi>Phaleg, c.</hi> 7. But there is no need of the help of this ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the Mountains of <hi>Ararat</hi> running a long way <hi>Eaſtward:</hi> From which when <hi>Noah</hi> and his Sons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended, they ſetled it's likely in Countries which were very much <hi>Eaſtward</hi> of
<hi>Aſſyria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They found a plain.</hi>] They continued to dwell in the Mountainous Countries of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> where the Ark reſted, till they grew very numerous, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted room; and then deſcended into the Plain, and ſome of them went <hi>Weſtwardly</hi> into the Land of <hi>Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nar,</hi> that pleaſant Plain (as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> fanſies) where God at the Beginning had placed the firſt Father of Mankind, <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shinar.</hi>] By this Name we are to underſtand not only that part of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> where <hi>Babylon</hi> ſtood; but all that Country which bordered upon <hi>Tigris</hi> unto the Mountains of
<hi>Armenia;</hi> from whence <hi>Noah</hi> and his Sons are ſuppoſed to have deſcended, when the Earth was dry, and not to have gone far from thence at firſt till they were multiplied; and then ſome of them came into this Country; which <hi>Noah</hi> had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited before the Flood. Thus
<hi>Bochart,</hi> in the place before-named. But there is no certainty the Ark reſted in <hi>Armenia;</hi> it might be further <hi>Eaſtward,</hi> upon ſome other part of that long Ridge of Mountains, called <pb n="221" facs="tcp:50230:118"/> 
                  <hi>Ararat:</hi> From whence they deſcended when the Earth was dry, and dwelt in the lower Grounds, which were warmer and more fruitful than the Mountains.</p>
               <p>But that from the <hi>Eaſt</hi> Mankind were propagated, is apparent from the increaſe of Arts and Sciences, which as Dr.
<hi>Jackson</hi> obſerves, (<hi>Book</hi> I. <hi>c.</hi> 16.) were in ſome meaſure perfected there, (in Times as anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent as any prophane Hiſtory can point us unto,) and thence derived as from a Center, to more remote parts of the World, the ripeneſs of Literature, civil Diſcipline, and Arts among the
<hi>Eaſtern</hi> People, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they did ſo much as bud forth in
<hi>Greece</hi> or <hi>Italy</hi> (I may add <hi>Egypt</hi> either) is a demonſtration, that theſe were the Stock, and the other but Slips or Branches tranſplanted from thence. Nay, the State and Grandure of thoſe
<hi>Eaſtern</hi> Countries, before <hi>Greece</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> or any other <hi>Weſtern</hi> People grew into the faſhion of a Kingdom, ſhows, that the <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern</hi> People were the Heirs of the World, and other Nations but as Colonies from them.</p>

<hi>Noah,</hi> by God's Direction, about the Ark. There was great plenty of it in <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> as <hi>Theodoret</hi> here obſerves, from ſome Fountains which vomited it up with the Water. And ſo <hi>Strabo</hi> and
<hi>Dion</hi> affirm, that it was very fit for this purpoſe; and
<hi>Herodotus</hi> ſays expreſly, that the Walls of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> were cemented with it; and ſo do many others, both <hi>Greek</hi> and
<hi>Roman</hi> Authors, mentioned by <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chartus, L.</hi> I. <hi>Phaleg, c.</hi> 13. And it is very obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that <hi>Arrianus</hi> ſaith,

                  <hi>A City and a Tower.</hi>] Some fanſie one thing to be expreſſed in two words: <hi>A City and a Tower,</hi> being a City with Turrets. But both this <hi>Verſe</hi> and the next, expreſs them ſo ſeverally, that we ought to think them to have been diſtinct. Yet, that the
<hi>Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> was part of the <hi>City,</hi> is plain by <hi>verſe</hi> 8. where it is ſaid, <hi>they left off to build the City,</hi> making no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Tower:</hi> Which was contained in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as a part of it; and may well be thought, to have been the <hi>Acropolis,</hi> (as the
<hi>Greeks</hi> ſpeak,) a ſtrong Place, in the higheſt part of the City; ſuch as we call a <hi>Cittadel.</hi> For the Scripture by a <hi>Tower,</hi>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:50230:119"/> means ſome Fortreſs to keep out an Enemy, which was wont to be built in the midſt of the City, that it might command every part of it.</p>
               <p>Some fanſie the Temple of <hi>Belus,</hi> before-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, was afterward built, where this <hi>Tower</hi> ſtood; and was nothing elſe but the <hi>Tower</hi> perfected for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſe.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, (as

                  <hi>Let us make us a Name,</hi> &amp;c.] Here he plainly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints us with their Intention in building this City and Tower: Which was to be a perpetual Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Fame. To ſpread it far and wide, while they were alive; and that their Names might live in this Monument when they were dead: All Poſterity ſaying, ſuch and ſuch Perſons were the Founders of the <hi>Firſt</hi> and <hi>Mother</hi> City of the World. So <hi>David</hi> is ſaid to have <hi>got himſelf a Name,</hi> 2
<hi>Sam.</hi> VIII. 13. <hi>i. e.</hi> extended his Fame by his great At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements. And God is ſaid to do the ſame, <hi>Iſai.</hi> LXIII. 12,
14. Therefore there was no occaſion for aſſigning other Reaſons for the building of this Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; when <hi>Moſes</hi> gives one ſo clearly. That which hath been commonly fanſied is, That they might ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure themſelves againſt another Inundation: From which they were ſecured by the Divine Promiſe, (if they would believe it,) together with the addition of a Sign to it, IX. 12. And, if they did not believe it, why did they come down from the Mountains in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the plain Country, to build this Tower; which might more rationally have been erected upon the top of the higheſt Mountains, if their meaning had been, by this means, to preſerve themſelves from fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Floods. If there were any other meaning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that mentioned by
<hi>Moſes,</hi> I ſhould think that moſt probable which I find in Dr.
<hi>Jackson,</hi> (<hi>Book</hi> I. <hi>on the Creed, c.</hi> 16.) That it might be <hi>a Refuge where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they might reſort, and continue their Combination:</hi> Something of which ſeems to be intimated in the next words. There is a Conjecture alſo made by a moſt worthy Friend of mine, a good while ago, Dr. <hi>Teni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> now Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> in his Book of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> (which is not inconſiſtent with theſe,) That this <pb n="225" facs="tcp:50230:120"/> Tower was conſecrated by the Builders of it to the Sun, as the cauſe of drying up the Waters of the Deluge (or rather, as the moſt illuſtrious and near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt reſemblance of the
<hi>Schechinah,</hi> as I noted on Chap. IV.) and that it was intended as an Altar whereon to Sacrifice to it. But it is propounded only as a Conjecture: Which thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> ſeem alſo to have had in their Minds, who by the Word <hi>Shem,</hi> (<hi>Name</hi>) underſtand God: As if their meaning were, <hi>Let us make us a God;</hi> and raiſe him a Temple. And perhaps future times did convert it to that uſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leaſt we be ſcattered abroad upon the Face of the whole Earth.</hi>] Here they ſpeak as if they feared a diſperſion; but it's hard to tell from what cauſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it were this, That <hi>Noah</hi> having projected a divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Earth among his Poſterity, (for it was a deliberate buſineſs, as I noted upon X. 5.) theſe People had no mind to ſubmit unto it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore built this Fortreſs to defend themſelves in their Reſolution of not yielding to his deſign. Thus the moſt learned
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher, ad A. M.</hi> 1757. But what they dreaded, they brought upon themſelves by their own vain attempt to avoid it: And now there is no memory preſerved of the Names of thoſe that conſpired in this attempt. Thus what
<hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, was long before verified, <hi>Prov.</hi> X. 24.
<hi>The fear of the Wicked ſhall come upon him.</hi> But this evil by God's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence was attended with a great Good: For by this diſperſion the whole Earth was peopled, and the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation laid of ſeveral great Nations and Kingdoms.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>And the LORD came down to ſee,</hi> &amp;c.] This is an accommodation to our conceptions; and means no more; but that by the Effects, he made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that he obſerved their Motions, and knew their Intentions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:50230:121"/>
                  <hi>Which the Children of Men builded.</hi>] It is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreed that <hi>Children of Men</hi> in Scripture, is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to <hi>Children of God:</hi> As bad Men and Infidels, are to the good and the Faithful. Which gives us to underſtand, that neither
<hi>Noah,</hi> nor <hi>Shem,</hi> nor <hi>Arphax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad, Salah</hi> or
<hi>Heber</hi> were engaged in this Work: But ſome of the worſer ſort of People who degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Piety of their Anceſtors. It is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable ſome of the Race of <hi>Ham;</hi> who it's likely carried much of the Spirit of <hi>Cain</hi> with him into the Ark: Otherwiſe he could not have behaved himſelf ſo vilely towards his Father after they came out of it. For that terrible Judgment, it ſeems, had not reformed him; and then it is no wonder if he grew more wicked after it was over. <hi>Joſephus</hi> and others take
<hi>Nimrod</hi> (his Grandchild) to have been the
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as his Word is, Ring-leader of this Crew, who combined in this deſign. But I take it to be more probable that he came and ſetled here after the Diſperſion. For there being not much above an <hi>Hundred</hi> Years between the Flood and this time, it is not likely ſuch a great Kingdom could be erected in that ſpace, as we read of,
<hi>Gen.</hi> X. 10. And therefore he grew ſo great after this Diſperſion, when he came out of <hi>Arabia,</hi> or ſome neighbouring Country, and ſetled here in <hi>Babel:</hi> Which was called by this Name, upon occaſion of the Confuſion of Languages, and had it not before. Which is an Argument that what we read, X. 10, 11. muſt be underſtood to have hapned after this time. But, if all this be true that ſome of <hi>Cham</hi>'s Race began this deſign, which other bad People were too much diſpoſed to follow, and that they who retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the true Religion (from whom
<hi>Abraham</hi> deſcended) <pb n="227" facs="tcp:50230:121"/> were not of the number, it is credible that they eſcaped the puniſhment here mentioned (in the next Verſes) retaining ſtill their ancient Seat, and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Language alſo; which continued in the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of <hi>Heber,</hi> and was called
<hi>Hebrew.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>And the LORD ſaid,</hi> &amp;c.] This Verſe only expreſſes a Reſolution to ſpoil their Project; and the neceſſity of ſo doing.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>Let us.</hi>] The <hi>Rabbins</hi> fanſie this is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the Angels. But it is beyond the Angelical Power to alter Mens Minds ſo in a moment, that they ſhall not be able to underſtand what they did before. Therefore God ſpake to himſelf: And this Phraſe ſuggeſts to us more Perſons than One in the Godhead. In ſhort, none but He who taught Men at firſt to ſpeak, could, in an Inſtant, make that variety of Speech, which is deſcribed in the next Words. <hi>Novatianus</hi> therefore anciently took it, that this was ſpoken by God to his Son.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Confound their Language.</hi>] The Word <hi>Confound</hi> is to be mark'd: For God did not make every one ſpeak a new different Language, but they had ſuch a confuſed remembrance of the Original Language which they ſpake before, as made them ſpeak it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry differently: So that by the various Inflections, and Terminations, and Pronunciations of divers Dialects, they could no more underſtand one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than they who underſtand
<hi>Latin</hi> can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand thoſe who ſpeak <hi>French, Italian,</hi> or <hi>Spaniſh;</hi> though theſe Languages ariſe out of it.</p>
               <p>And yet it is not to be thought, there were as many ſeveral Dialects as there were Men; ſo that none of them underſtood another: For this would not meerly have diſperſed Mankind, but deſtroyed
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:50230:122"/> them. It being impoſſible to live without Society, or to have Society without underſtanding one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: For if the Father could not have underſtood the Son, nor the Husband his Wife, there could have been no comfort in living together. Therefore it is likely that every Family had its peculiar Dialect; or rather the ſame common Dialect (or way of ſpeaking) was given to thoſe Families, whom God would have to make one Colony in the following Diſperſion. Unto which Diſperſion they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by their not being able to have ſuch fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity as they had before with every body; but only with thoſe who underſtood their particular Speech.</p>
               <p>Into how many Languages they were divided, none can determine. The <hi>Hebrews</hi> fanſie into LXX. which Opinion hath much prevailed: Being grounded upon the foregoing Chapter; where the Deſcendants from the Sons of <hi>Noah</hi> are juſt ſo many. The <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers make them LXXII. becauſe the <hi>Greek</hi> Verſion adds two more (<hi>Eliſa</hi> among the Sons of <hi>Japhet,</hi> and <hi>Cainan</hi> among the Sons of <hi>Shem</hi>) and the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> Fathers follow them. But this is a very weak Foundation; it being apparent that many of the Sons of
<hi>Canaan</hi> uſed the very ſame Language in their Country, and ſo did
<hi>Javan</hi> and <hi>Eliſhah</hi> in <hi>Greece:</hi> And in other places ſo many concurred in the Uſe of the ſame Speech, that ſcarce
<hi>Thirty</hi> remains of the <hi>Seventy</hi> to be diſtinct, as

<hi>Maimonides</hi> will have it, (in the place before-named) that the

               <p>
                  <hi>And in thee ſhall all the Families of the Earth be bleſſed.</hi>] Which was moſt eminently fulfilled in Chriſt. And here it muſt be remarked that this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, of Bleſſing all the World in
<hi>Abram,</hi> was made to him before he received Circumciſion, while he was in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r</hi> of the <hi>Chaldees,</hi> and before he had any Iſſue, (for <hi>Sarai</hi> was <hi>barren</hi> and <hi>had no Child,</hi> XI. 30.) And

<hi>Iſhmael;</hi> or any diſtinction made between his Poſterity, and the reſt of Mankind. In token that they were all concerned in this Promiſe; whether deſcended from <hi>Abraham,</hi> or not. In ſhort, this Promiſe only limits the Birth of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> to the Seed of
<hi>Abraham;</hi> but declares that his Benefits ſhould be common to all other Nations.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>So Abram departed,</hi> &amp;c.] Having ſtaid ſome time in <hi>Haran,</hi> where his Father fell ſick and died, he proſecuted his Journey from thence to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> after his Father was dead.

<hi>from thence</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> from <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi>) <hi>when his Father was dead, he removed him into this Land,</hi> &amp;c. It was a wonderful effect of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith (I obſerved before) to move him to leave his own native Country and go to <hi>Haran:</hi> But it was ſtill a greater, after he had travelled a long way from <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r</hi> hither; to go <hi>three hundred</hi> Miles more from hence to <hi>Canaan;</hi> a Country of which he had no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, nor had ſent any Body before him to diſcover it: Taking his Journey through the dangerous and barren Deſarts of <hi>Palmyrena;</hi> and having nothing to ſupport him, but only the Promiſe of God. Which made him climb over the high Mountain, either of <hi>Libanus, Hermon,</hi> or

<hi>Abram</hi> carry with him. And ſome of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors are ſo nice, as to ſay, That <hi>Abram</hi> inſtructed the Men, and
<hi>Sarai</hi> the Women, in the true Religion: Concerning which he wrote a Book (if we may believe <hi>Maimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides, De Idolol. c.</hi> 1.) and left it to his Son <hi>Iſaac.</hi> We read alſo in <hi>Pirke Elieſer, c.</hi> 25. that he took a Houſe, which fronted <hi>Charran,</hi> where, according to the ancient Piety, he kept great Hoſpitality: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting thoſe that went in or came out of the Town, to refreſh themſelves if they pleaſed, ſet Meat and Drink before them; ſaying, <hi>There is but one God in the World.</hi>

                  <hi>And into the Land of Canaan they came.</hi>] We are told before, XI. 31. that <hi>Terah</hi> went forth to go to this Country, but could not reach it, as <hi>Abram</hi> did. Who entred into it, at the <hi>North</hi> part of it, as appears by the following part of the Story: Where we read he went to <hi>Sichem,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>verſe</hi> 9. went on <hi>ſtill to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the South.</hi>

                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:50230:129"/>
                  <hi>And the Canaanite was then in the Land.</hi>] It was very pertinent to <hi>Moſes</hi> his Deſign, ſpeaking of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bram</hi>'s Paſſage through this Country, to tell who was at that time poſſeſſed of it. But it is dubious whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he mean by the
<hi>Canaanite</hi> a particular People de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from <hi>Canaan,</hi> as he doth XV. 21. or, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, all the Nations, which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> afterward deſtroyed. It ſeems to me the firſt of theſe is meant, and that by <hi>Land</hi> he means only that part of the Country where
<hi>Sichem</hi> lay, which was then poſſeſſed by this particular People. For, in the next place that <hi>Abram</hi> went to, it is ſaid,
<hi>The Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the Land,</hi> (XIV. 7.)
<hi>i. e.</hi> in that part of the Country. Where we do not read what Entertainment <hi>Abram</hi> met withal; but I take it, as an Argument of
<hi>Abram</hi>'s great Faith, that he would adventure among ſuch a rough and fierce People: Who had no kindneſs for the Poſterity of <hi>Shem</hi> upon an old Score; and, if the ancient Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>Epiphanius</hi> be true, upon a freſh Account. For he ſaith, (<hi>Haereſ.</hi> LXVI. <hi>n.</hi>
84.) that this Country cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Canaan,</hi> did really belong to the Children of <hi>Shem,</hi> by Virtue of the Diviſion made among the Sons of
<hi>Noah:</hi> But the Children of <hi>Canaan</hi> had diſpoſſeſſed them. So that theſe words, <hi>the Canaanite was then in the Land,</hi> ſignifies, they had already invaded this Country, before <hi>Abram</hi> came thither. To whom God promiſing to give it, he only reſtored the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity of <hi>Shem,</hi> (from whom <hi>Abram</hi> deſcended) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that which the Children of <hi>Ham</hi> had wrongfully ſeized.</p>
               <p>By all which it is eaſie to ſee how frivolous their Reaſonings are, who from this place conclude <hi>Moſes</hi> did not write this Book: Becauſe theſe words ſeem <pb n="243" facs="tcp:50230:129"/> to ſignifie the Writer of them lived after the <hi>Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi> were thrown out of this Land: Which was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Moſes</hi> his death.</p>
               <p>If theſe Men had not a greater inclination to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, than to find out the Truth, they would rather have ſaid the meaning is, The
<hi>Canaanite</hi> was poſſeſſed of this part of the Country in
<hi>Abraham</hi>'s time, though thrown out of it by <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Sons, (<hi>Gen.</hi> XXXIV.) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Times of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Which is another way of explaining theſe words: Againſt which I ſee no Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection but this, That their Prince is called an <hi>Hivite,</hi> XXXIV. 2. To which there is an Anſwer, <hi>verſe</hi> 30. which ſhows the People were partly
<hi>Canaanites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>And the LORD appeared unto Abram.</hi>] As he had done before, (<hi>Verſe</hi> 1.) but now, it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in a more glorious manner; to eſtabliſh him in Faith and Obedience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſaid unto him,</hi> &amp;c.] There was a Voice came from the <hi>Schechinah,</hi> or <hi>Divine Glory,</hi> which now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to him; and told him this was the Country he intended to beſtow upon his Poſterity. It is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry remarkable that he no ſooner entred <hi>Canaan,</hi> but God renewed his Promiſe to him, made before he came out of his own Country.</p>
               <p>And it is further obſervable, (as we ſhall ſee in the following Story,) that <hi>Abram</hi>'s Obedience was conſtantly rewarded in kind, according to the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Service he performed: Though, in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, the Reward far exceeded the Service. Thus having left his own Country and Father's Houſe, (which was the firſt trial of his Obedience,) God promiſes to give him the whole Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and to make his Poſterity a mighty Nation. See XVII. 6. XXII. 16.</p>

<hi>Iſraelites</hi> conquered the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> For here was the Sanctuary of God in <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s time, near this very Grove where

               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>And he removed from thence unto a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> &amp;c.] Though the LORD here appeared to him, yet he did not think fit to truſt himſelf among the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> (who were the chief of the wicked Nations, that poſſeſſed this Land,) or, he thought fit to ſee the reſt of the Country, which God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to give him: And therefore came hither, which was about <hi>twenty</hi> Miles further
<hi>Southward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And there he built an Altar.</hi>] Upon the
<hi>Mountain;</hi> where they anciently choſe to ſacrifice, rather than in other places. And, it is likely, God again appeared to him here, to incourage and ſtrengthen him againſt all his Fears. Which made him build a new Altar and offer Sacrifices of Thankſgiving to God, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore his continued Favour.</p>
               <p>And it is obſervable, That the Promiſe which God made in the former place, <hi>verſe</hi> 7. he renewed again in this, and more at large, after he came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> XIII. 3, 4, 14, 15, 16.</p>

<hi>Vau,</hi> denotes Eternity; though without <hi>Vau</hi> they confeſs it ſignifies only a long time. But this ſmall Obſervation is quite over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown by many Examples to the contrary.

               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>Ariſe, walk through the Land,</hi> &amp;c.] He would have him, for his ſatisfaction, go and view it all more nearly, in every part of it. Or, he gives him leave (if he deſired to underſtand more fully, both the Quality and Quantity of the Inheritance he beſtowed on him) to go and ſurvey it: Promiſing he would protect and preſerve him in his perambu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. <pb n="252" facs="tcp:50230:134"/> Nay, ſome look upon this, as giving him a Warrant to take poſſeſſion of the Country, though he ſhould not yet enjoy it.</p>
               <p>Ver. 18. <hi>Then Abram removed his Tent.</hi>] To a place about
<hi>twenty four</hi> Miles from <hi>Bethel,</hi> where he was before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And dwelt in the Plain.</hi>] Here the word we had before XII. 6 is in the Plural Number; and is taken by many for <hi>Oaks,</hi> i. e. for an <hi>Oaken Grove:</hi> So the <hi>Arabick</hi> Interpreter. The LXX tranſlate it, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>, <hi>by the Oak,</hi> in the Singular Number; for there ſeems to have been one
<hi>Oak</hi> more eminent than the reſt. Under which <hi>Abram</hi> pitched his Tent, and built an Altar unto the LORD.</p>
               <p>This is confirmed by XVIII. 1. compared with <hi>Verſe</hi> 8. And indeed the Ancients very much reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced an <hi>Oak,</hi> and therefore planted this Tree very frequently. <hi>Jacob</hi> buried the Idolatrous Trumpery of his Family under an <hi>Oak,</hi> (XXXV. 4.) which was by
<hi>Schechem,</hi> where the place of Publick Worſhip ſeems to have been fix'd in <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s time, <hi>Joſh.</hi> XXIV. 1, 26. The Angel of the LORD alſo appeared to <hi>Gideon</hi> under an <hi>Oak, Judg.</hi> VI.
11, 19, 25. IX. 6. And of all other Trees, an <hi>Oak</hi> was held moſt Sacred by the <hi>Heathen;</hi> particularly by the <hi>Druids.</hi> See

               <p>This <hi>Oak</hi> ſome fanſie was in being in the time of

His Grand-Son, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> II. 42, 43. may rather be thought to have taken his Name from this Place, than to have given a Name to it. Beſides, there have been two Occaſions of giving one and the ſame Name; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by what is ſaid of
<hi>Beerſheba,</hi> XXI. 31. XXVI. 33. And therefore this City might have the Name of <hi>Hebron</hi> in <hi>Moſes</hi> his time; and it might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s.</p>

               <p>Ver. 1. <hi>AND it came to paſs,</hi> &amp;c.] It is very eaſie to give an Account of this War, which the Kings of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> made upon the King of <hi>Sodom and Gomorrha,</hi> &amp;c. if what was ſaid before, XII. 6. be admitted; that the <hi>Canaanites</hi> had invaded the Rights of the Children of <hi>Shem,</hi> and gotten Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a Country belonging to them; which they now endeavoured to recover, (as they had attempted before, <hi>verſe</hi> 4.)

<hi>Chedorlaomer</hi> was King, deſcended from <hi>Shem, Gen.</hi> X. 22.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amraphel king of Shinar.</hi>] <hi>i. e.</hi> King of
<hi>Babylon,</hi> as it is commonly underſtood. But it cannot well be thought that ſo Potent a King, as he is ſuppoſed to have been in thoſe days, ſhould need any Aſſociates in a War againſt ſuch petty Princes, as thoſe menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned <hi>verſe</hi> 2. Or, that the King of <hi>Elam</hi> (whoſe Quarrel this was, as appears from <hi>verſe</hi> 4.) ſhould not be able of himſelf to grapple with them: Or, that the Kings of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> &amp;c. durſt have adventured, with a handful of People in compariſon, to rebel againſt him, after he had brought them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his ſubjection. Therefore we muſt either take <hi>Amraphel</hi> to have been ſome ſmall Prince in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Shinar,</hi> i. e.
<hi>Aſſyria:</hi> Or, if he were King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that Monarchy was not very great in the days of <hi>Abram.</hi> And we muſt alſo look upon the reſt as Names of ſome particular Places (like <hi>Sodom</hi> and

                  <hi>Tidal king of Nations.</hi>] Some take <hi>Gojim</hi> in this place, which we tranſlate <hi>Nations,</hi> for a Country or City. But it is more agreeable to the common uſe of the word in Scripture, to take it to ſignifie a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: Who either wanted a fixed Habitation, or were gathered out of ſundry Regions.</p>
               <p>Thus part of <hi>Galilee</hi> being inhabited by a mixed People of divers Countries, was thence called <hi>Galilee of the Nations,</hi> or

But the ſimpleſt Sence is; many of them <hi>were ſlain,</hi> and the reſt, as it follows, eſcaped to the Mountain. But made ſuch ill uſe of their Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from being killed with their Fellows, that they only lived to ſuffer a greater Vengeance.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>And they took all the Goods,</hi> &amp;c.] This is a further proof that <hi>Chedorlaomer,</hi> and the reſt of his Confederates in this War, were but petty Princes, (like the Kings of <hi>Sodom</hi> and
<hi>Gomorrha,</hi> &amp;c.) for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving broken the Army of the Five Kings, they reſted contented and march'd away with the Priſoners and Booty; but took not one of their Cities: Which, if they had been ſuch great Kings, as is imagined, they would have certainly ſack'd, and perhaps burnt, if they had not thought fit to keep them.

               <p>
                  <hi>And theſe were confederate with Abram.</hi>] The
<hi>three</hi> forenamed Families were near Neighbours to <hi>Abram;</hi> who, it is likely, farmed (as we now ſpeak) ſome Ground of them: And ſo entred into a League of Mutual Defence, having the ſame Intereſt. I ſhould think alſo, that having the Prieſt of the moſt High God not far from them,
<hi>Verſe</hi> 18. they were good, <pb n="260" facs="tcp:50230:138"/> pious People, (rather than conclude, as I find ſome do, that they were utter ſtrangers to the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion) which made <hi>Abram</hi> more forward to embrace, if not to court, their Friendſhip. For the Sins of the <hi>Amorites</hi> being not yet full, (XV. 16.) there might be ſome remainders of true Piety among them: And it is no argument, that becauſe theſe <hi>three</hi> Families were of that Nation, they were wicked Idolaters.</p>

               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>And he divided himſelf againſt them, he and his ſervants by night.</hi>] The <hi>Vulgar Latin</hi> here reads, <hi>His Companions being divided, he fell upon them by Night:</hi> Minding rather the ſence, than the words. For here is no mention of any but <hi>Abram</hi> and his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: Though it appears by the laſt <hi>Verſe</hi> of the

<hi>Melchizedeck</hi> entertained him with Bread and Wine.</p>
               <p>Ver. 18. <hi>And Melchizedeck.</hi>] The <hi>Jews</hi> generally ſay this was <hi>Shem,</hi> the Son of <hi>Noah.</hi> But we have reaſon to look upon this Opinion, as proceeding <pb n="262" facs="tcp:50230:139"/> from their Pride and Vanity: Which could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to think the Father of their Nation had any Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior in another Nation, eſpecially among the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites.</hi> And therefore they will have <hi>Abram</hi> to have been bleſſed by his great Anceſtor, <hi>Shem;</hi> to whom alſo he paid Tithes: Which is a fancy ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confuted by the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that it is ſtrange any Chriſtian ſhould follow it. For he ſaith expreſly, that

<hi>Levi</hi> paid him Tithes in the Loins of <hi>Abram,</hi> but it would be as true that he received Tithes in the Loins of <hi>Shem:</hi> For, according to this Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, he was in the Loins both of him that received Tithes, and of him that paid them; and ſo the whole Argumentation of the Apoſtle falls to the Ground. But ſetting aſide theſe and other Chriſtian Reaſons, (which are ſtrongly urged by <hi>Bochartus, L.</hi> II.
<hi>Phaleg, c.</hi> 1.) there is no Cauſe, that we can diſcern, why
<hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould call <hi>Shem</hi> (whom he ſo often mentions) by any other Name than his own: Nor is it likely that <hi>Shem</hi> reigned in the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> which now was in the poſſeſſion of his Brother's Son: Nor could <hi>Abram</hi> be ſaid to <hi>ſojourn there as in a ſtrange Country,</hi> if his Noble Anceſtor, <hi>Shem,</hi> had been a King there.

<hi>Salem</hi> was in the way which led from the Valley of <hi>Damaſcus</hi> unto <hi>Sodom:</hi> Which we learn from this very place of Scripture. And ſo St. <hi>Hierom</hi> ſays, that he learnt from the <hi>Jews</hi> in his time, that it was ſeated on this ſide of <hi>Jordan:</hi> And it retained it's Name in our Saviour's days, as appears by the Story of <hi>John</hi>'s Baptizing near <hi>Salim, Joh.</hi> III. 23.

Thus Heathens themſelves underſtood this Hiſtory, as we find by <hi>Eupolemus,</hi> (quoted by <hi>Euſebius, L.</hi> IX. <hi>c.</hi> 17.) who ſaith he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>Abram</hi> as they were wont to do ſtrangers; in a City called <hi>Argarizin,</hi> which he interprets the <hi>Mount of the moſt High:</hi> We know not in what Language it ſo ſignifies, or whether it be miſprinted for <hi>Harelion:</hi> But, I think, the plain Sence is, that he treated <hi>Abram</hi> and his followers, by cauſing Proviſions to be brought forth for their Refreſhment after the Fight. For <hi>Bread and Wine</hi> comprehend all ſort of Proviſion for their Repaſt: As to <hi>eat Bread</hi> with another, in this Book, is <hi>to feaſt</hi> with him, XLIII. 25.

And indeed it was a very ancient Cuſtom to offer to God (whoſe Prieſt <hi>Melchizedek</hi> was) the tenth part of what they took in War. <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> reports it of the
<hi>Greeks;</hi> and many Authors of the <hi>Romans.</hi> From whence we cannot inferr that they gave only Tithe of ſuch things; but, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that theſe were extraordinary Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God's Mercy to them: Which it was uſual to make, out of thoſe Poſſeſſions which he had bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them withal. For why ſhould they give Tithe of the Spoils, if they were not wont to pay Tithe <pb n="266" facs="tcp:50230:141"/> of other things? And therefore St

The <hi>Jews</hi> truly obſerve, that they who ſtaid with the Stuff and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, had their Portion equal with thoſe that fought: As we read in the Story of
<hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> XXX. 25. But it is not certain that this Cuſtom was as old as <hi>Abram</hi>'s time; which they would gather from this place. For here they take the <hi>young Men</hi> for thoſe who fought and purſued the Enemy: And <hi>Aner, Eſhcol,</hi> and <hi>Mamre,</hi> ſtaid to guard the Carriages. But I ſee no ground for this; it being moſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as I obſerved before, that they attack'd the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, as well as
<hi>Abram</hi>'s Servants; and thereby acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a Title to part of the Spoil. But whether we conſider it this way, or the other, <hi>Abram</hi> could not give away their Right, when he generouſly parted with his own.</p>

               <p>Ver. 1. <hi>AND after theſe things.</hi>] After this great Victory, and his generous refuſal of the King of <hi>Sodom</hi>'s offer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Word of the LORD came to Abram.</hi>] God revealed himſelf more clearly to him. For this is the firſt time we read, of the
<hi>Word of the LORD</hi> coming to him; and of his having a Viſion: That is, being made a Prophet, and that in an high Degree; <pb n="268" facs="tcp:50230:142"/> God revealing his Mind to him, not in a <hi>Dream,</hi> but in a <hi>Viſion;</hi> when he was awake, but having his Senſes (as <hi>Maimonides</hi> explains it) bound up from their ordinary Functions; during the time that the heavenly Influence came upon his Mind, and diffuſed it ſelf to his Imagination; where it repreſented ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things to him. <hi>More Nevochim, P.</hi> II.
<hi>c.</hi> 41. But theſe words may be underſtood, of his having theſe things repreſented to him, by the <hi>Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty;</hi> when he was perfectly awake, and uſed all his Senſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fear not, Abram.</hi>] He heard theſe words, while he was in the Ecſtaſie, (according to <hi>Maimonides</hi>'s Explication) incouraging his hope in God, that he and <hi>Lot</hi> ſhould be ſafe from any new Invaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by theſe, or any other, Enemies. For, perhaps, there were ſome Rumors abroad of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruiting their Forces; with an intention to renew the War.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I am thy Shield.</hi>] I will protect and defend thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And thy exceeding great Reward.</hi>] Will give thee far more, than thou haſt lately denied to take, for my ſake.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>LORD God, what wilt thou give me,</hi> &amp;c.] What good will all the Riches in the World do me, if I have not a Child to inherit my Eſtate?</p>
               <p>To <hi>go childleſs.</hi>] Is to die, (to go out of the World without Children) as <hi>Luke</hi> XXII. 22. <hi>truly the Son of Man goeth,</hi> i. e. muſt die ſhortly. He doth not ſlight God's Promiſe made in the foregoing <hi>Verſe;</hi> but only deſires him to be ſo gracious as to give him a Child for his <hi>Reward.</hi>

                  <hi>And the Steward of my Houſe is this,</hi> &amp;c.] He that takes Care of all I have, (and therefore deſerves beſt of me) is not of my Kindred.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eliezer of Damaſcus.</hi>] Some think this ſignifies no more, but that he was born of a <hi>Syrian</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>And Abram ſaid,</hi> &amp;c.] He repeats the ſame again, out of a great Concern to have God's Promiſe fulfilled: Which he did not disbelieve, but earneſtly long'd for, more than for all the Riches in the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>One born in my Houſe is my Heir.</hi>] It is likely, that
<hi>Eliezer</hi> was one of thoſe <hi>Souls</hi> (i. e. Servants) <hi>gotten in Haran,</hi> (XII. 5.) and had been ſuch a wiſe and faithful Manager of all things committed to his Care, that <hi>Abram</hi> intended, before the Promiſe made to him, to have left him his Heir: Thinking he ſhould have no Child of his own; <hi>Sarah</hi> being barren, as we read, XI. 30.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>And behold, the Word of the LORD came to him,</hi> &amp;c.] A new Aſſurance is given him, from the <hi>Schechinah,</hi> or
<hi>Divine Majeſty,</hi> that he ſhould have an Heir begotten by himſelf.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>And he brought him forth abroad, and ſaid,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>Maimonides</hi> thinks (<hi>More Nev. P.</hi> II. <hi>c.</hi> 46.) that all this which follows was done in a Viſion. But others will have it, that he was really conducted out of his Tent into the open Air, and look'd upon the Stars. The former Opinion is more probable, becauſe the Sun was not yet gone down, <hi>verſe</hi> 12. and therefore the Stars were not to be ſeen with the Eye, but were repreſented only in a Viſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So ſhall thy ſeed be.</hi>] <hi>Nehem.</hi> IX. 23. He not only promiſes him an Heir; but that this Heir ſhould
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:50230:143"/> have a numerous Poſterity. Which, as before XIII. 16. he compared to the Duſt of the Earth; ſo here he compares to the Stars of Heaven. Showing (ſay ſome of the <hi>Jews</hi>) by the former their Humiliation; and by this their Exaltation and Advancement. And indeed, in this
<hi>Chapter,</hi> he ſpeaks of both.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>He believed in the LORD.</hi>] Was fully perſuaded that God both could and would perform his Promiſe; though it ſeemed to be very difficult, if not impoſſible, according to the ordinary courſe of Nature: He and <hi>Sarah</hi> both, being very old.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he counted it to him for righteouſneſs.</hi>] The Lord eſteemed it a moſt noble Act, and high Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a pious Confidence in him, (as that Act of <hi>Phineas</hi> was, in after-times,
<hi>Pſalm</hi> CVI. 31.) and thereupon graciouſly owned him for a righteous Perſon: Though he was not free from all Sin what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; but was guilty of ſome that were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with perfect Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>It is here to be conſidered, That <hi>Abram</hi> believed this Promiſe before, (XII. 1, 2, 3, 4.) but now his Faith was the more remarkable; becauſe, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſome time had paſſed ſince the firſt making of the Promiſe, and he had no Iſſue; he ſtill perſiſted in the belief, that God would beſtow a Son upon him; though it grew every day more and more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>I am the LORD that brought thee,</hi> &amp;c.] He re-minds him of what he had already done for him; that he might confirm him in the belief of what he promiſed further to do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To give thee this Land,</hi> &amp;c.] To beſtow it upon thy Children for their Inheritance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="271" facs="tcp:50230:143"/>Ver. 8. <hi>Whereby ſhall I know,</hi> &amp;c.] This is not ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken doubtingly; for the ſtrength of his Faith is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commended; but he deſires to have it more and more ſtrengthned and confirmed: As ſome good Men did in after-times, when they were put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on very difficult Services. So <hi>Gideon, Judg.</hi> VI. 37, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>And he ſaid unto him, Take me an Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>i. e.</hi> Offer unto me (ſo it ſhould be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, as Mr.
<hi>Mede</hi> obſerves, <hi>Book</hi> II. <hi>p.</hi> 472.) the following Creatures: Which are of four Sorts. From whence the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors would perſuade us the riſe and the fall of the <hi>four Monarchies</hi> are ſignified in theſe words. But it is a better Obſervation, That God hereby fore-ſignified their Sins ſhould be expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Sacrifices. For theſe were the Creatures, and theſe alone, which were appointed to be offered in ſacrifice to God, by the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> And it juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies their Opinion, who think there were <hi>clean</hi> and <hi>unclean</hi> Beaſts, with reſpect to Sacrifice, before the Law; though not with reſpect to Meat.</p>
               <p>Yet here is ſomething ſingular, That God required
<hi>Abram</hi> to offer an Heifer of <hi>three Years old,</hi> with a
<hi>Goat</hi> and a <hi>Ram</hi> of the ſame Age; whereas after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, under the Law, they were commonly <hi>of one Year old.</hi> I know not the reaſon of this difference; but certain it is, that a Ram of <hi>three Years old,</hi> is in its full ſtrength, and the vigour of its Age; as <hi>Bochart</hi> obſerves. Whence it is that <hi>Lucian</hi> intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces <hi>Ganymede</hi> proffering to offer unto <hi>Jupiter,</hi> (if he would diſmiſs him,)

<hi>Jeremy,</hi> XXXIV. 18, 19.

Becauſe Covenants were made by dividing a Beaſt, and by the Parties covenanting, paſſing between the parts of the Beaſt, ſo divided: Signifying, that ſo ſhould they be cut aſunder who broke that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. Thus Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> in the place fore-mentioned, truly explains this Rite; which was as much as if they had ſaid: <hi>Thus let me be divided and cut in pieces, if I violate the Oath I have now made in the preſence of my God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We find in <hi>Zenobius</hi> that the People called

               <p>It muſt here be noted, That from the Birth of

Thus the <hi>Greek</hi> Interpreters of the <hi>Bible</hi> are commonly called the LXX: Though there were <hi>Seventy two</hi> of them.

               <p>If it ſeems a difficulty, that their ſojourning is ſaid in

But un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Name is comprehended all the other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Canaan.</hi> Who were very wicked; but God forbare them till their Wickedneſs had overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the whole Country, and that to the greateſt heighth. Their moſt heinous Iniquities, were abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Idolatries, Cruelty, beaſtly Filthineſs, to a prodigious exceſs, <hi>Levit.</hi> XVIII. 22, 23, &amp;c. See <pb n="277" facs="tcp:50230:146"/>
                  <hi>Theodoret</hi> upon <hi>Pſalm</hi> CV. 44. and <hi>P. Fagius</hi> upon
<hi>Levit.</hi> V. 1.</p>
               <p>But in <hi>Abram</hi>'s time their Iniquity was <hi>not full: i. e.</hi> There were ſeveral good Men ſtill remaining among them, as
<hi>Mamre, Eſhcol,</hi> and <hi>Aner</hi> ſeem to have been, who were confederate with <hi>Abram;</hi> and <hi>Melchizedek</hi> certainly was, who being Prieſt of the moſt high God, had ſome People ſure worſhipped together with him. And therefore God ſtaid till there was an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Corruption, and they were all ripe for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. For we read of none but
<hi>Rahab</hi> whoſe Faith ſaved her and her Family, when the time of their Deſtruction came.</p>
               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>Behold, a ſmoking Furnace.</hi>] If the <hi>great horror, Verſe</hi> 12: repreſented the extream Miſery of the Children of
<hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Egypt:</hi> Then this ſeems to ſignifie God's Vengeance upon the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> for op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing them in the Furnaces, wherein they wrought, <hi>Exod.</hi> IX. 8.</p>

                  <hi>Paſſed between the pieces.</hi>] In Token, as it follows, <hi>verſe</hi> 18. that he entred into a Covenant with
<hi>Abram</hi> and with his Poſterity: For <hi>paſſing between</hi> the pieces, he conſumed them, (as St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands it,) and thereby teſtified his Acceptance of the Sacrifices which <hi>Abram</hi> offered. I noted before, that there is no ſuch Rite we read of any where in Scripture, but in <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> of making a Covenant in this manner. But there are thoſe who think they <pb n="278" facs="tcp:50230:147"/> find this Cuſtom in other Nations: For if <hi>Dictys Cretenſis</hi> do not Lye, after the manner of the <hi>Creti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> (as <hi>Bochart</hi> ſpeaks) both the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jans,</hi> from the time of
<hi>Homer,</hi> did make Covenants, in this faſhion. Certain it is, the
<hi>Boeotians</hi> and <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians</hi> paſſed on ſome occaſions, through the parts of a Beaſt diſſected: But it was for
<hi>Luſtration,</hi> not for Covenanting, as the ſame <hi>Bochart</hi> obſerves, <hi>P.</hi> I. <hi>Hierozoic. L.</hi> II. <hi>cap.</hi> 46.</p>

<hi>Euphrates.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The River of Egypt.</hi>] So <hi>Nile</hi> is commonly called, but cannot be here meant; becauſe the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver enjoyed all the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> on this ſide <hi>Nile.</hi> Therefore we are to underſtand by it, that little Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which came out of that Branch of <hi>Nile,</hi> called <hi>Peluſiacum Brachium:</hi> From whence a ſmall River not Navigable, ran toward <hi>Judaea;</hi> falling into the
<hi>Egyptian</hi> or <hi>Phoenician</hi> Sea. For this River was the Bounds of
<hi>Paleſtine;</hi> and is mentioned by <hi>Strabo</hi> and others, whom
<hi>G. Voſſius</hi> cites, <hi>L.</hi> II. <hi>De Idolol. c.</hi> 74. It is called, <hi>Amos</hi> VI. 14. <hi>the River of the Wilderneſs;</hi> becauſe it run through the Wilderneſs, which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Egypt</hi> and
<hi>Paleſtine,</hi> into the Sea.</p>
               <p>Ver. 19. <hi>The Kenites,</hi> and <hi>Kenizzites.</hi>] Theſe are put into the Number of the Nations, whoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try God gave to
<hi>Abram;</hi> but whether they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from any of the Sons of
<hi>Canaan</hi> we cannot tell: Nor are we certain where they dwelt. Only
<hi>Euſtathius,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> ſays the
<hi>Kenites</hi> dwelt about <hi>Libanus</hi> and <hi>Amanus:</hi> And the
<hi>Kenizzites</hi> it's <pb n="279" facs="tcp:50230:147"/> likely were their Neighbours. But the Names of theſe People were quite extinct between the times of
<hi>Abram</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> for we find no mention of them by
<hi>Joſhua</hi> in the Diviſion of the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> nor in the Account he gives of the Nations he conquered. We read indeed of the
<hi>Kenezites, Numb.</hi> XXXII. 12. <hi>Joſh.</hi> XIV. 6, 14. but they were of the Children of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And of the <hi>Kenites, Judg.</hi> I. 16. IV. 11, 17. but they deſcended from the Father-in-law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi> And therefore thoſe whom <hi>Moſes</hi> here ſpeaks of, it is probable loſt their Name, being incorporated into ſome of the <hi>ſeven</hi> Nations who inhabited this Country when <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſubdued it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Kadmonites.</hi>] Theſe are no where elſe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned: But are thought by <hi>Bochartus</hi> to be the ſame with the
<hi>Hivites:</hi> Who living about Mount <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> toward the
<hi>Eaſt</hi> of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> were thence called
<hi>Kadmonites,</hi> i. e. <hi>Orientals.</hi> See X. 17.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Perizzites.</hi>] They were a People inhabiting the Mountainous and woody Country of <hi>Canaan,</hi> as appears from
<hi>Joſh.</hi> XI. 3. XVII. 13. From whence we may gather they were a wild ſort of People, who lived far from Cities, in little Villages; and thence perhaps had their Name: For <hi>Pherazoth</hi> in <hi>Hebrew</hi> ſignifies,
<hi>Pagi,</hi> Villages. But from which of the Sons of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> they deſcended, there is not the leaſt ſignification in Holy Scripture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rephaim.</hi>] They dwelt in <hi>Baſhan;</hi> and perhaps in other Countries thereabouts. See XIV. 5.</p>
               <p>Ver. 21. <hi>Amorites.</hi>] Theſe were the mightieſt Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> See X. 16.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Canaanites.</hi>] Theſe were ſome of the Poſterity of
<hi>Canaan,</hi> who peculiarly inherited his Name; living
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:50230:148"/> upon the Sea-Coaſt, and upon the Banks of <hi>Jordan, Num.</hi> XIII. 30. <hi>Deut.</hi> I. 7. XI. 30. And it is a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Conjecture, That they ſprang from ſuch of <hi>Canaan</hi>'s Sons, as had, for a time, the greateſt Power and Authority in that Country: And therefore had the Prerogative of being called by his Name. Or elſe, they were ſo called, becauſe they were <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,</hi> and great Traders by Sea. For ſo the word is uſed in Scripture.</p>

               <p>Ver. 1. <hi>SArai bare him no Child.</hi>] Still the fulfilling of God's Promiſe was deferred; for the greater trial of <hi>Abram</hi>'s Faith. Which now had held out ten Years, (<hi>Verſe</hi> 3.) without ſeeing any Fruit of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She had an handmaid, an Egyptian.</hi>] An <hi>Egyptian</hi> by Nation; but a Proſelyte to the true Religion. St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> thinks <hi>Pharaoh</hi> beſtowed her upon <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rai,</hi> when he took her into his Houſe, or when he ſent her away, XII. 15, 20. Which he learnt from the <hi>Jews,</hi> who ſay the ſame; as may be ſeen in <hi>Pirke Elieſer, c.</hi> 26. who ſays alſo, as <hi>R. Solomon Jarchi</hi> doth, that ſhe was <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Daughter, by his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine. But it is more likely ſhe was ſuch a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to <hi>Sarai</hi> as <hi>Eliezer</hi> was to
<hi>Abram;</hi> born in his Houſe of an <hi>Egyptian,</hi> as he was of a

               <p>
                  <hi>It may be I may obtain Children by her.</hi>] Being born of her Bond-ſlave, they would be <hi>Sarai</hi>'s Children; according to the Cuſtom of thoſe Times, XXX. 3. <hi>Exod.</hi> XXI. 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And Abram hearkned to the Voice of Sarai.</hi>] Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, perhaps, that God might fulfil his Promiſe this way; becauſe he had only told him he ſhould have Seed, but had not, as yet, ſaid by
<hi>Sarai.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>Gave her to her Husband Abram to be his Wife.</hi>] A ſecondary Wife, (which was a Liberty they took in thoſe days) who was not to be Miſtreſs of the Houſe; but only to bear Children, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the Family. Now I can ſee no good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why
<hi>Sarai</hi> her ſelf ſhould perſuade her Husband (contrary to the Inclination of all Women) to take another Wife, which ſhe her ſelf alſo gave him; but only the eager deſire ſhe was poſſeſſed withal of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the promiſed Seed. Which gives a good Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count alſo, of
<hi>Jacob</hi>'s Wives contending ſo earneſtly, as they did, for his Company.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>Her Miſtreſs was deſpiſed in her Eyes.</hi>]
<hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi> began to take upon her, as if ſhe had been Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs of the Houſe; at leaſt much more favoured by God, who had made her Fruitful: Which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a great Bleſſing, and Honour in thoſe days; eſpecially in a Family that had no Heir.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>My wrong be upon thee.</hi>] Thou art the cauſe of this Injury (or theſe Affronts) which I ſuffer, by <pb n="282" facs="tcp:50230:149"/> being too indulgent to my Maid, and not repreſſing her Inſolence. Or, it is incumbent on thee, to ſee me redreſſed of the Wrong that is done me. See <hi>Lud. de Dieu.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Lord judge between me and thee.</hi>] Sometimes this Phraſe ſignifies an Appeal to God, as the Aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Wrongs: But here it ſeems only to denote her committing the Equity of her Cauſe to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>Behold, thy Maid is in thy hand.</hi>] Is ſubject unto thee.</p>

                  <hi>She fled from her Face.</hi>] Run away, to avoid her cruel uſage.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>And the Angel of the LORD,</hi> &amp;c.] This is the firſt time that we read of the appearance of an <hi>Angel.</hi> By whom
<hi>Maimonides</hi> will ſcarce allow us to underſtand more, than a Meſſenger, (<hi>More Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voch. P.</hi> II. <hi>c.</hi> 42.) But ſome Chriſtians go ſo far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the other extream, as to underſtand hereby, the Eternal ΛΟΓΟΣ, or Son of God. It ſeems to me more reaſonable, to think, that though the <hi>Schechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah,</hi> or <hi>Divine Majeſty,</hi> did not appear to her; as it had often done to <hi>Abram:</hi> Yet one of the heavenly Miniſters, who were Attendants upon it, and made a part of its Glory, was ſent to ſtop her Proceedings. And a great Favour it was, that the LORD would diſpatch ſuch a Meſſenger after her: Who was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to do the buſineſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:50230:149"/>
                  <hi>In the way to Shur.</hi>] She was flying into <hi>Egypt,</hi> her own Country, (upon which the Wilderneſs of
<hi>Shur</hi> bordered) and only reſted a while at this Fountain, to refreſh her ſelf.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>And he ſaid, Hagar, Sarai's Maid.</hi>] He takes notice of her being <hi>Sarai</hi>'s Maid, rather than <hi>Abram</hi>'s Wife; to put her in mind of her Duty; and that ſhe could not honeſtly leave her Miſtreſs without her Conſent: For ſo it follows in the next
<hi>Verſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>Return to thy Miſtreſs, and ſubmit,</hi> &amp;c.] It is the ſame word here tranſlated <hi>ſubmit,</hi> with that
<hi>Verſe</hi> 6. where it is rendred <hi>dealt hardly:</hi> Signifying that ſhe ſhould be Patient, and indure the Hardſhip of which ſhe complained, (or, ſuffer her ſelf to be afflicted by her.)</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>I will multiply,</hi> &amp;c.] I will make thee partaker of the Promiſe, I have made to <hi>Abram,</hi> XV. 5. The Angel delivers this Meſſage to her, in the Name of God, who ſent him.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>Behold, thou art with Child,</hi> &amp;c.] Do not doubt of what I ſay; for thou art with Child of a Son, who ſhall be the Father of a great People. This Promiſe was renewed to <hi>Abram</hi> in the next <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> XVII. 20. and we find was performed, XXV. 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shalt call his Name Iſhmael.</hi>] Some of the
<hi>Jews</hi> take notice of the Honour which was here done him, in calling him by his Name before he was born: There being but <hi>Six</hi> they ſay, who were thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from others; the two firſt were the Sons of
<hi>Abram,</hi> (<hi>Iſhmael,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi>) and the laſt was the <hi>Meſſias.</hi>

                  <hi>The LORD hath heard thy affliction.</hi>] Thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint under the Affliction thou haſt endured from thy Miſtreſs, and here in the Wilderneſs. This Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage <pb n="284" facs="tcp:50230:150"/> ſhows it was an Angel which appeared and ſpake to her from the LORD, and not the LORD him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>A wild Man.</hi>] The <hi>Hebrew</hi> word
<hi>Phere</hi> here joyned with <hi>Man,</hi> ſignifies a <hi>wild Aſs:</hi> And ſo is well tranſlated by <hi>Bochart, tam ferus quam onager, as wild as a wild Aſs.</hi> Which loves to ramble in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts; and is not eaſily tamed, to live in ſociety.</p>
               <p>

<hi>Iſaac,</hi> or from the reſt of <hi>Abram</hi>'s Sons by
<hi>Keturah:</hi> Who, though annoyed by him, ſhall not be able to diſpoſſeſs him. This is ſuch an exact Deſcription of the Poſterity of <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all Generations, that none but a Prophetick Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit could have made it; as Doctor <hi>Jackson</hi> truly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, (<hi>Book</hi> I. <hi>on the Creed, c.</hi> XXV.) wildneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo incorporated into their Nature, that no change of Times hath made them grow tame.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>She called the Name of the LORD that ſpake to her.</hi>] By his Angel, for ſhe look'd upon the Preſence of the Angel, as a Token of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Preſence; though ſhe ſaw it not in its full Glory.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>For ſhe ſaid, Have I alſo here looked after him that ſeeth me?</hi>] There are various Interpretations of theſe words: The plaineſt is that of <hi>De Dieu:</hi> Who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves that the word
<hi>Halom</hi> always ſignifies <hi>Place,</hi> not <hi>Time;</hi> or, that which is done in any Place; and ſo <pb n="285" facs="tcp:50230:150"/> we tranſlate it by the word <hi>here.</hi> But there he makes a ſtop, after that word, by way of admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; in this manner: <hi>And even here alſo!</hi> Or, <hi>even thus far!</hi> It had been leſs wonder, if God had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Care of me in my Maſter's Houſe; but doth he follow me with his Favour, even hither? This is wonderful. And then the next words, (<hi>have I looked after him that ſeeth me</hi>) carried this ſence, Have I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held God, who taketh Care of me? What a Favour is this that he would ſo far Condeſcend to me? It ought never to be forgotten; therefore ſhe called his Name, <hi>Thou God ſeeſt me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>Beer-lahai-roi.</hi>] Some would have this referr, both to <hi>Hagar,</hi> and to God; in this manner: <hi>The Well of her that liveth, and of him that ſeeth,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> who preſerves me in Life.) So it was an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment that ſhe owed her Life and Safety to God.</p>
               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>Abram called his Son's Name,</hi> &amp;c.]
<hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi> having told him at her return the foregoing Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he gave his Son this Name; in Obedience to the Angel's Command, <hi>Verſe</hi> 11.</p>

11. That is, the memorial of the Angel's paſſing them by, when he killed the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, XIII. 9. But Circumciſion was ſuch a Sign, that they entred thereby into a Covenant with God to be his People. For it was not a mere Mark, whereby they ſhould be known to be <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, and diſtinguiſhed from other Nations: But they were made by this, the Children of the Covenant, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to the Bleſſings of it. Though, if there had been no more in it but this, That they who were of the ſame Faith, as <hi>Maimonides</hi> ſpeaks, ſhould have one certain Character, whereby they ſhould be known and joyned one to another, without the mixture of any other People; it had been a very wiſe appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And this Mark was very fitly choſen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was ſuch a Token, as no Man would have ſet upon himſelf and upon his Children; unleſs it were for Faith and Religion ſake. For it is not a <pb n="289" facs="tcp:50230:152"/> Brand upon the Arm, or an Inciſion in the Thigh; but a thing very hard, in a moſt tender part: Which no Body would have undertaken, but on the fore-named account. <hi>P.</hi> III.
<hi>More Nev. c.</hi> 49.</p>
               <p>It may be proper here to add; That Covenants were anciently made in thoſe <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Countries, by dipping their Weapons in Blood, (as
<hi>Xenophon</hi> tells us) and by pricking the Fleſh, and ſucking each others Blood, as we read in <hi>Tacitus.</hi> Who obſerves, (<hi>L.</hi> XII.
<hi>Annal.</hi>) that when Kings made a League, they took each other by the Hand, and their Thumbs being hard tied together, they prick'd them, when the Blood was forced to the extream parts, and each Party lick'd it: Which he ſaith was accounted <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num foedus, quaſi mutuo cruore ſacratum,</hi> a myſterious Covenant, being made Sacred by their mutual Blood. How old this Cuſtom had been, we do not know: But it is evident God's Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> was ſolemnized on <hi>Abraham</hi>'s part, by his own and his Son <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s Blood, and ſo continued through all Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, by cutting off the Fore-skin of their Fleſh, (as it follows in the next <hi>Verſe</hi>) whereby as they were made the Select People of God: So God in concluſion, ſent his own Son, who by this very Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony of Circumciſion, was conſecrated to be their God and their Redeemer.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>Ye ſhall circumciſe the Fleſh of your foreskin.</hi>] <hi>i. e.</hi> The Foreskin of your Fleſh: For that Member, which is the Inſtrument of Generation, is peculiarly called by the Name of
<hi>Fleſh,</hi> in many places, <hi>Lev.</hi> XV. 2. <hi>Ezek.</hi> XVI. 26. In which part of the Body, rather than in any other, God appointed the Mark of his Covenant to be made; that they might be deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be an <hi>Holy Seed,</hi> conſecrated to him from the <pb n="290" facs="tcp:50230:153"/> beginning. The
<hi>Pagans</hi> made Marks in ſeveral parts of their Bodies, (ſome in one, ſome in another) whereby they were conſecrated to their Gods: But the Character which God would have imprinted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his People, was in one peculiar part and no other, (from which they never varied,) <hi>viz.</hi> In that part which ſerved for the Propagation of Mankind. Of which ſome have given
<hi>Natural,</hi> others <hi>Moral</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; but the moſt plain and obvious is, That it might be an apt Token of the Divine Covenant made with
<hi>Abraham</hi> and his Poſterity: That God would multiply their Seed, and
<hi>make them as the Stars of Heaven,</hi> XV. 5. It is probable alſo, that this part was choſen, rather than any other; to make them ſenſible, that this was a Divine Sacrament: For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but God's Inſtitution, could at firſt engage Men to lay that part bare, which Nature hath co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
               <p>It is of late indeed made a Queſtion by ſome learned Men, whether this were the Original of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion: Which they fanſie the
<hi>Jews</hi> borrowed from the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and not the
<hi>Egyptians</hi> from the <hi>Jews.</hi> Certain it is, That not only the
<hi>Egyptians,</hi> but ſeveral other Nations, did very anciently uſe Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion. Now it is improbable, ſay they, that the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> (who ſeem to have had it the moſt early of all Nations, who ſprang not from <hi>Abraham</hi>) would borrow this Cuſtom from the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> whom they perfectly hated, (Shepherds being an abomination to them, XLVI. 34.) and therefore they give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the liberty to ſay, That God did not now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn <hi>Abraham</hi> a new thing, when he ordered him to be circumciſed; but only made this a Sign of his Covenant with him, which it was not with other <pb n="291" facs="tcp:50230:153"/> Nations. But unleſs it can be proved that Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion was in uſe before <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time, (which doth not appear from any good Authors, though ſuch as <hi>Celſus</hi> were ſo bold as to affirm it, as we find in <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen, L.</hi> V.) ſuch Arguments as theſe will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade us to believe, that it came from the
<hi>Egyptians</hi> or any other Nation: But they had it, if not from the
<hi>Hebrews,</hi> yet from the Poſterity of <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> or other People deſcended from <hi>Abraham.</hi> Who being highly beloved of God, it is not credible that God would ſet the Mark of <hi>Ham</hi>'s Race upon him and his Poſterity: Much leſs make it the Token of his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with them. See <hi>J. Ludolphus, L.</hi> III. <hi>Comment. in Hiſtor. Aethiop. C.</hi> I. <hi>n.</hi> 3.

<hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> were the firſt inhabiters of the Earth, unleſs perhaps the <hi>Phrygians.</hi> This Opinion proceeded from their own vain Conceit; which made them loath to confeſs they received Circumciſion from any other People. Though I think there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Argument of it in
<hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf; who tells us in <hi>Chapter</hi> X. 14. that the
<hi>Philiſtim</hi> came from the <hi>Caſluchim,</hi> i. e. the People of
<hi>Colchis;</hi> as that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple came originally from <hi>Egypt.</hi> (So
<hi>Herodotus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Diodorus,</hi> and abundance of other credible Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, teſtifie.) This, it appears by what I noted there, was before the time of <hi>Moſes,</hi> nay, before <pb n="292" facs="tcp:50230:154"/>
                  <hi>Abraham:</hi> For the <hi>Philiſtim</hi> had a King among them in his days: As we read in this <hi>Book,</hi> XX. and XXVI. Now theſe
<hi>Philiſtim</hi> were an uncircumciſed People, and therefore the People of <hi>Colchis</hi> no doubt were ſo alſo, when they went out of their Country, and drove the <hi>Avim</hi> out of <hi>Paleſtine.</hi> And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the <hi>Egyptians</hi> had no ſuch Rite among them, when the

<hi>Paleſtine,</hi> (whom he calls <hi>Syrians</hi> and <hi>Phoenicians</hi>) confeſſed they received Circumciſion from the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> For there were no Inhabitants of <hi>Paleſtine</hi> circumciſed but the
<hi>Jews,</hi> who always profeſſed they received it from <hi>Abraham.</hi> Who, we may be confident was the firſt Perſon in the World that was circumciſed: There being nothing to induce any Body to uſe ſuch a Rite, unleſs they had been directed to it by God, as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was. From whom the <hi>Iſhmaelites</hi> received it; and from them the
<hi>Arabians:</hi> And from thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, or from <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Children by <hi>Keturah,</hi> it was derived (as ſeems moſt probable to me) to the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians:</hi> From whom the People of <hi>Colchis,</hi> who knew themſelves to be an <hi>Egyptian</hi> breed, imbraced it; in imitation of their famous Anceſtors. But, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time, who found no ſuch Rite among the <hi>Philiſtim,</hi> a Colony of theirs; to whom in all likelihood they would have communicated it, as the <hi>Egyptians</hi> did to them, if it had been then uſed in that Country.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>And he that is eight days old,</hi> &amp;c.]
<hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides</hi> thinks that if Circumciſion had not been
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:50230:154"/> performed in their Infancy, it might have been in danger to have been neglected afterward. For an Infant felt not ſo much Pain as an adult Perſon would have done; in whom the Fleſh is more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact, and his Imagination ſtronger. The Parents al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, (eſpecially Fathers) have not ſo ſtrong an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to a Child when he is newly born, as they have when he is grown up: And ſo more eaſily ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to this harſh Rite, at their firſt appearance in the World; than they would have done, after they were more endeared to them. But the Child could not be circumciſed before the
<hi>eighth</hi> Day after his Birth; becauſe till then he was look'd upon as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect; and not yet ſufficiently cleanſed and purged: For which reaſon Beaſts were not accepted by God, till <hi>ſeven</hi> Days were paſt, after their Birth, <hi>Exod.</hi> XXII. 30. See <hi>More Nevoch. P.</hi> III. <hi>cap.</hi> 49.</p>
               <p>And, as the Child was not to be circumciſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the
<hi>eighth</hi> Day, ſo he was not (unleſs perhaps in caſe of great weakneſs) to be kept uncircumciſed beyond that Day. On which, if the Parents did not cauſe it to be circumciſed, the <hi>Houſe of Judgment,</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> ſpeak, were bound to do it. And if they did not (being ignorant perhaps of the neglect) the Child when he came of Age, (<hi>i. e.</hi> was <hi>thirteen</hi> Years old) was bound himſelf to get it done. If he did not, the Judges (if it were known to them) were obliged to take care of it: As Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> obſerves, <hi>L.</hi> I. <hi>de Synedr. cap.</hi> 6. <hi>p.</hi> 96, 97.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>He that is born in thy Houſe, or bought with Money, muſt needs be circumciſed.</hi>] Not whether they would or no: For Men were not to be compelled to Religion; which had been a profanation of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.

<pb n="294" facs="tcp:50230:155"/> and, if they conſented not, to keep them no longer in his Houſe: But to ſell them to ſome other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

               <p>What it is to be <hi>cut off</hi> is very much diſputed. The ſimpleſt Sence ſeems to be, he ſhall not be accounted one of God's People. But the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally take this to have been a Puniſhment inflicted by <hi>the Hand of Heaven,</hi> i. e. of God: Though they be much divided in their Opinions about it.

<hi>De Synedr. L.</hi> I. <hi>c.</hi> 6. and more briefly <hi>L' Empereur</hi> in his Notes upon <hi>Cornel. Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram De Republ. Jud. p.</hi> 351. Some ſay it was the ſhortning of the Man's Life; others ſay it was the making him Childleſs; ſo that his Family and Name periſhed in <hi>Iſrael.

Some Chriſtians would have it, to be <hi>Excommunication:</hi> Which cannot be, becauſe ſuch a Perſon never was a Member of the Church, which he was to be made by Circumciſion. The firſt of theſe Opinions ſeems more probable than the <pb n="295" facs="tcp:50230:155"/> reſt: For God himſelf ſaith of ſeveral Offenders, to whom he threatens this Puniſhment, <hi>I will cut him off,</hi> and <hi>I will ſet my face againſt him,</hi> Lev. XVII. 10. XX. 5, 6. XXIII. 30. Yet in other places, it muſt be confeſſed, this <hi>Cereth,</hi> or cutting off, ſignifies more largely, a Puniſhment by the Judge, and not by the Hand of God. And therefore the ſignification of it muſt be determined by the Matter, with which it is joyned. Thus the violation of the Sabbath is threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with <hi>cutting off,</hi> Exod. XXXI.

<hi>Schechinah,</hi> as it had done lately, XVII. 1. And as the LORD then appeared to eſtabliſh his Covenant with him, by Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion: So ſome of the <hi>Jews</hi> imagine he again appeared to viſit, comfort, and heal him, now that he was very ſore of his Circumciſion. Or, rather, I ſhould think, to teſtifie by this illuſtrious Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Glory, (<hi>Verſe</hi> 2.) his high Approbation of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ready Obedience to ſo harſh a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.

               <p>However this be, I think it is plain from <hi>Verſe</hi> 10. that this Appearance of the Divine Majeſty, was not long after the former.</p>

                  <hi>And lo, there ſtood three Men by him.</hi>] Three An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, in the ſhape of Men, (for ſo the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> calls them, XIII. 2. And ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf calls two of them, XIX. 1.) who were part of the heavenly Retinue, as I may call it, waiting upon the Divine Majeſty, mentioned in the <hi>Verſe</hi> foregoing. There is a Maxim among the <hi>Jews</hi> that no <hi>Angel per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms <pb n="299" facs="tcp:50230:157"/> two Miniſtries,</hi> (is ſent, that is, on two Meſſages) nor are <hi>two Angels ſent upon one Embaſſie,</hi> (as <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides</hi> ſpeaks,
<hi>More Nev. P.</hi> II. <hi>c.</hi> 6.) and therefore they think theſe
<hi>three</hi> Angels were diſpatch'd for dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Purpoſes; one of them, and the Principal, to bring a Confirmation of the Birth of <hi>Iſaac;</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to bring <hi>Lot</hi> out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and a third to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Cities of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha.</hi> And therefore when one of theſe Angels had delivered that Meſſage to <hi>Abraham,</hi> there were but <hi>two</hi> that went to <hi>Sodom,</hi> XIX. 1. and <hi>Lot</hi> ſpeaks to <hi>one</hi> of them, as taking a particular Care of him, <hi>verſe</hi>

That is, that Angel of the Lord, who was ſet by the LORD of Heaven and Earth over that Work. Some of them indeed aſſign another Work for one of them, (as we find in that Title of the <hi>Talmud</hi> called <hi>Bava-Metzia, c.</hi> 7.) but they agree in the main Notion, That they had different Offices with which they were intruſted. But ſome Chriſtians, and thoſe of great Authority, have made a Queſtion whether they were all created Angels; one of them at leaſt, ſeeming to be the LORD of all. Nay, St. <hi>Cyril</hi> in his firſt Book againſt
<hi>Julian</hi> thinks there was a Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the bleſſed, individed Trinity; for <hi>Abram</hi> ſpeaks to them, <hi>verſe</hi> 4.

<hi>L.</hi> V. <hi>Demonſtr. c.</hi> 9.) is more likely, That the Son of God only appear'd with two Angels at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending on him: Which many think is evident from <hi>verſe</hi> 22, and 25. of this <hi>Chapter.</hi> Yet, I think, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Account may be given of thoſe <hi>Verſes;</hi> and if we ſhould make that an Argument that one of them <pb n="300" facs="tcp:50230:158"/> was the

               <p>
                  <hi>And bowed himſelf towards the Ground.</hi>] After the manner of the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> People; in Token of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and Honour he had for them. For this was a Civil Action (not Religious) it is manifeſt by this: That he did not know them to be Angels; but only Perſons of Quality, (as we now ſpeak) their Aſpect and Habit, I ſuppoſe, being extraordinary.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>My Lord, if now I have found,</hi> &amp;c.] One of them appeared more Honourable and Superior to the other two; and therefore he makes his addreſs to him, as the chief: Praying him, if he thought him worthy of ſuch a Favour, to honour him with their Company.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>And reſt your ſelves under the Tree.</hi>] In an Arbour under a great Tree: Where they were wont to eat, for coolneſs ſake. See Dr.
<hi>Hammond</hi> upon <hi>Pſalm</hi> CXXVIII. 3. St. <hi>Hierom</hi> ſometimes calls this Tree, an Oak; ſometimes a Turpentine-Tree, (as <hi>J.

Unleſs we will ſay, that he thought <hi>Abraham</hi> dwelt under the one, and entertained them under the other. And ſo <hi>Euſebius, L.</hi> V.
<hi>Demonſt. Evang. c.</hi> 9. expreſly relates it, That
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:50230:158"/> God appeared to him under the <hi>Oak,</hi> where he dwelt: And that he entertained the Angels under a <hi>Turpentine-Tree;</hi> which was had in great Honour in his time.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>I will fetch a morſel of Bread.</hi>] Or, rather, a Loaf of Bread; as <hi>de Dieu</hi> ſhows the word im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports: Under which is comprehended, all neceſſary Proviſion at a Meal.</p>

               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>Make Cakes upon the Hearth.</hi>] Many inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret it upon the <hi>Coals,</hi> or <hi>hot Embers;</hi> according to what we read, 1
<hi>Kings</hi> XIX. 6. But <hi>Bochartus</hi> thinks the word there, ſignifies as it doth here, upon <hi>hot Stones.</hi> Others will have it, that they were laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Hearth and covered with hot Embers, (<hi>P.</hi> I. <hi>Hierozoic. L.</hi> II. <hi>c.</hi> 34.) and ſo they prepare them at this Day, as <hi>Leon. Rawwolff</hi> tells us in his Travels, <hi>P.</hi> II.
<hi>c.</hi> 9. where he ſaith, That as he went through a Country, that lies between <hi>Meſopotamia</hi> and <hi>Media,</hi> a Woman preſently made them Cakes, about a Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger thick, and of the bigneſs of a Trencher: Which ſhe firſt laid upon hot Stones, and turned them of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; and then threw Aſhes and Embers over them: Which he ſays were very ſavoury.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>A Calf tender and good.</hi>] Which was a noble Entertainment in thoſe Countries.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>And he took Butter.</hi>] Though we read of
<hi>Cheeſe</hi> in <hi>Homer, Euripides, Theocritus,</hi> and others; yet they never mention Butter: Nor hath <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> a word of it, (as

                  <hi>c.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 41.) though he hath ſundry Obſervations about
<hi>Cheeſe:</hi> For <hi>Butter</hi> was not a thing then known among the

               <p>
                  <hi>And he ſtood by them.</hi>] Waited upon them and miniſtred to them. For he did not ſtand unmova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but as Servants do that attend upon the Table; who, as there is occaſion, bring or take away,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> See <hi>P. Fagius</hi> on <hi>Deut.</hi> I. 38.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>And they ſaid unto him, Where is thy Wife?</hi>] One of them (the reſt ſignifying ſome way their Conſent) ask'd him for his Wife; not being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, but to introduce the following diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the Tent.</hi>] In her Apartment: For Women had their Apartments by themſelves.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>And he ſaid.</hi>] The Principal of the three Angels; or, rather, the LORD himſelf, as it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, <hi>verſe</hi>
13. For, as <hi>Theodorick Hackspan</hi> judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly obſerves, this appearance of the <hi>Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi> was different from the foregoing: Not being <hi>immediate</hi> by himſelf alone, like that XVII. 1. nor merely
<hi>mediate</hi> by an Angel, like that XVI. 7, 10, 11, 12, &amp;c. But
<hi>mixed,</hi> the LORD himſelf (<hi>ver.</hi> 1.) being conjunct with the Angels, whom he imployed in this Embaſſie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will certainly return to thee.</hi>] To fulfil the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe which I made thee, XVII. 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>According to the time of life.</hi>] Nine Months hence; which is the time of perfecting the Life of a Child in the Womb. This appears to be the Sence from <hi>verſe</hi> 14. where he calls it the <hi>time appointed,</hi> or a ſet time.</p>

                  <hi>In the Tent door, which was behind him.</hi>] The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels ſat with their Backs to <hi>Sarah</hi>'s Tent: Unto the Door of which ſhe was come to liſten, having heard that they ask'd for her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Behind him.</hi>] This ſhows the Truth of what
<hi>Hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpan</hi> notes, That this was a <hi>mixt</hi> Apparition: For this word <hi>him</hi> plainly relates to the Angel, whoſe words were in truth the LORD's, who was there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. For as he obſerves in another place, (<hi>Diſput.</hi> II. <hi>de Nominibus Divinis, n.</hi> 15.) the Scripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates theſe Matters ſo, that ſometimes it mentions the principal Cauſe, whoſe words are related; ſometimes only the ſecondary Cauſe: In which latter Caſe, it muſt be underſtood, That when the words exceed the Dignity of the Miniſter, the LORD himſelf ſpake them. For the Sacred Writers mind more by whoſe <hi>Authority</hi> any thing is ſpoken, than by whoſe <hi>Miniſtry:</hi> So that it is not much material, from whoſe Mouth any Meſſage comes; but what is ſaid, muſt be attended. This will be made plainer, when I come to <hi>Gen.</hi> XXII. 11, 12, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>It ceaſed to be with Sarah after the manner of Women.</hi>] She was no longer capable of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; according to the ordinary courſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>Laughed within her ſelf.</hi>] Not as
<hi>Abraham</hi> for Joy; but out of Incredulity: Not thinking it poſſible for an old Woman, to Conceive by an old Man. And her ſmiling at this, was the more excuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe ſhe did not know them to be Angels of the LORD, but took them only for ſome great Men.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>And the LORD ſaid.</hi>] The <hi>Divine Majeſty</hi> (mentioned <hi>Verſe</hi> 1.) ſaid, Why doth ſhe
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:50230:160"/> not believe my Meſſenger? The Angel ſpake theſe words, but the words were the LORD's, (not his) who was now preſent with the Angels, and in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time appeared without them, <hi>verſe</hi> 17, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>At the time appointed will I return to thee.</hi>] Take it from my ſelf, that what hath been told thee by them, ſhall be effected.</p>
               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>Sarah denied.</hi>] Fear (as it follows) put her into a confuſion: So that ſhe did not mind what ſhe ſaid. Otherwiſe ſhe would not have denied, what ſhe might well think they knew. Therefore ſhe is only made ſenſible of her Fault, by a ſimple Affirmation, of what ſhe denied; without any further Reproof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nay, but thou didſt laugh.</hi>] The Perſon that ſpeaks, ſeems to have turned to her, and ſaid, Do not deny, what I know to be true.</p>
               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>Looked toward Sodom.</hi>] As if they intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to travel that way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And Abraham went with them, to bring them on the way.</hi>] A piece of Civility like the former: Having entertained them, he accompanied them ſo far as to direct them in the Road to <hi>Sodom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>And the LORD ſaid.</hi>] The <hi>Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,</hi> mentioned <hi>Verſe</hi> 1. began now to diſcourſe plainly and openly with him; not by the miniſtry of Angels, but by himſelf. For, I take it, the three An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, had now left <hi>Abraham</hi> alone: Who returning towards his Tent, ſaw the Glory of the LORD, and heard him ſpeak what follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shall I hide from Abraham,</hi> &amp;c.] Theſe words ſeem to have been ſpoken to <hi>Abraham:</hi> Otherwiſe, how came he to expoſtulate with the LORD, as he doth, <hi>verſe</hi> 23, &amp;c. unleſs we will conceive, (as we may) <pb n="305" facs="tcp:50230:160"/> 
                  <hi>Verſe</hi> 20, 21. to be the <hi>declaration</hi> of God's Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to deſtroy <hi>Sodom:</hi> And theſe words and the next, to be his <hi>reſolution</hi> within himſelf, to acquaint <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> with that Intention.</p>
               <p>Ver. 18. <hi>Seeing that Abraham ſhall ſurely,</hi> &amp;c.] This is one reaſon why the <hi>Divine Majeſty</hi> reſolves to acquaint
<hi>Abraham</hi> with his intended Proceedings: Becauſe he had already revealed to him greater things, and made him moſt gracious Promiſes.</p>
               <p>Ver. 19. <hi>For I know,</hi> &amp;c.] This <hi>Verſe</hi> contains ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon; becauſe he knew <hi>Abraham</hi> would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove himſelf ſo faithful to him: That he would not fail to enjoy all that he had promiſed.</p>
               <p>

13. and diſcourſed with him, <hi>verſe</hi> 17, 20. in whoſe Preſence he ſtill continued. Some by <hi>ſtood</hi> underſtand, he prayed: But that follows in the next <hi>Verſe.</hi>

                  <pb n="307" facs="tcp:50230:161"/>Ver. 23. <hi>Abraham drew near.</hi>] Approached to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Divine Majeſty,</hi> to make his Addreſſes by Prayer and Supplication to him. Perhaps the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty</hi> remained in the place where it firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, <hi>verſe</hi> 1. and
<hi>Abraham</hi> by conducting the <hi>three</hi> Men ſome part of their way, being gone further from it, now came nearer to it. Though the Phraſe doth not neceſſarily import it, to <hi>draw nigh</hi> to God, in the Holy Language, ſignifying no more but to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wilt thou deſtroy the righteous with the wicked?</hi>] As much as to ſay, I know thou wilt not. For ſuch Queſtions ſtrongly deny; as in <hi>verſe</hi> 17.</p>
               <p>Ver. 24. <hi>Fifty righteous within the City.</hi>] Of
<hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> which was the Chief, and comprehended the reſt of the Country of <hi>Pentapolis:</hi> Which one would gueſs, by <hi>Gen.</hi> XIV.
17. depended upon <hi>Sodom</hi> as the <hi>Metropolis.</hi> So what is ſaid here of it, I take to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr to the whole Region.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wilt thou not ſpare the place for the fifty,</hi> &amp;c.] He deſires <hi>two</hi> things of God. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That he would not deſtroy the Righteous with the Wicked. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That he would ſpare the Wicked for the ſake of the Righteous; if any conſiderable Number of them were found among the Wicked.</p>
               <p>Ver. 25. <hi>Shall not the Judge of all the Earth do right?</hi>] This referrs (as we tranſlate it) only to the firſt part of his Requeſt, <hi>not to deſtroy the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous with the Wicked.</hi> Which was contrary to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Juſtice, much more to that exact Juſtice, which is adminiſtred by the Supreme Lord of the World: From whom there lies no Appeal. But, according to the <hi>Vulgar</hi> Tranſlation, which is this, [<hi>Thou who judgeſt all the Earth, wilt by no means exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute <pb n="308" facs="tcp:50230:162"/> this Judgment,</hi>] it referrs to the other part alſo: That God would not be ſo ſevere as to deſtroy a whole Country; whilſt there were many good Men ſtill remaining in it: And ſo the word <hi>Right,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes in it
<hi>Clemency.</hi> And indeed this Paſſage ſeems to relate to both parts of his Requeſt: And is to be interpreted thus; <hi>Shall not the Supreme Judge ſhow Mercy, as well as do Juſtice?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 26. <hi>And the LORD ſaid, If I find fifty,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>then will I ſpare,</hi> &amp;c.] This ſhows the foregoing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation to be right: God promiſing moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly to be merciful to all, for the ſake of a few, in compariſon with the Multitude of Offenders.</p>
               <p>Ver. 27. <hi>Who am but Duſt and Aſhes.</hi>] Very mean and vile.</p>
               <p>Ver. 28. <hi>Lack five of the fifty righteous.</hi>] A great Argument of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Modeſty; who durſt not preſume to ask too much at once; but by degrees proceeds, in the following <hi>Verſes,</hi> to petition for grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter abatements: And that with fear and trembling, leſt the LORD ſhould be angry with his impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.</p>
               <p>Ver. 32. <hi>I will not deſtroy it for tens ſake.</hi>] A won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful repreſentation of the tender Mercy of the moſt High; who condeſcended ſo low as to grant a Reprieve to the whole Country, for the ſake of ſo ſmall a Number, if they could have been found in it. And his Mercy was ſtill greater, even beyond <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>'s deſire; for he ſpared one of the <hi>five</hi> Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: For the ſake of <hi>three</hi> or
<hi>four</hi> Perſons, as we read XIX. 20, 21.</p>
               <p>We do not find, that <hi>Abraham</hi> makes expreſs men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Lot</hi> in any of the foregoing Petitions: But it is plain from XIX.
29. that he was in his Thoughts, <pb n="309" facs="tcp:50230:162"/> which God knew; and he is comprehended in thoſe words, <hi>Verſe</hi> 23. of this <hi>Chapter; Wilt thou deſtroy the Righteous with the Wicked?</hi>

               <p>Ver. 33. <hi>And the LORD went his way.</hi>] The <hi>Divine Majeſty,</hi> or <hi>the Glory of the Lord,</hi> diſappeared (and aſcended perhaps towards Heaven) after this Communication with

               <p>Ver. 1. <hi>AND there came two Angels.</hi>] There were

                  <hi>Lot ſat in the gate of Sodom.</hi>] The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors will have it, that he was made a Judge in this City; and the prime Judge of all: For they adventure to Name <hi>five</hi> (in <hi>Bereſchith Rabba</hi>) and ſay <hi>Lot</hi> was the Preſident of the Court, which ſat in the Gate of the City. But this is only a fanſie of theirs: He ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſat <hi>in the Gate</hi> of this City, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did at his
<hi>Tent door;</hi> to invite Strangers to his Houſe, (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Hoſpitality of thoſe days) which was the greater Charity, becauſe he knew the City to be ſo wicked, that (if we may believe the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors) they not only denied them all aſſiſtance, but
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:50230:163"/> abuſed them and were cruel to them, (ſee <hi>Gemara Sanhedrim, C.</hi> XI. <hi>&amp; Pirke Elieſer, cap.</hi> 25.) for which laſt, they quote thoſe words of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> XXII. 29. <hi>they have oppreſſed the ſtranger wrongfully.</hi> Which are ſpoken of

                  <hi>Roſe up to meet them,</hi> &amp;c.] Juſt as
<hi>Abraham</hi> did; whoſe Civility he imitates, as well as his Charity.

               <p>
                  <hi>And they ſaid, Nay,</hi> &amp;c.] It was as great a Civility in ſtrangers, not to be forward to accept, as it was in him to invite. And therefore they refuſe him at firſt, to try his Kindneſs: But intending, no doubt, to embrace his offer, if he preſſed them further. So the following words are to be underſtood.</p>

                  <hi>From every quarter.</hi>] Or, as ſome underſtand it, from the moſt extream parts of the City: As in <hi>Pſalm</hi> XIX. 4. One, it ſeems, told another, what goodly Perſons were come to their City: And all ran to the Houſe where they heard they were; with the ſame wicked Inclinations.

               </p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>That we may know them.</hi>] A modeſt word for a lewd Fact. Some indeed will have it underſtood ſimply, of their examining what they were, whence they came, and what their buſineſs was. Which might perhaps be their pretence; but <hi>Lot</hi>'s anſwer to them,
<hi>verſe</hi> 7, 8. interprets their meaning to be filthy.</p>

               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>Behold now, I have two Daughters,</hi> &amp;c.] This muſt be underſtood to have been ſpoken, in a great perturbation and perplexity of Mind; and out of a vehement Deſire to preſerve the Men whom he had entertained: Which made him ſay, he had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſhould abuſe his own Daughters, than thoſe Strangers.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>This one fellow,</hi> &amp;c.] Here is one, and he but a Sojourner; who takes upon him to be a <hi>Cenſor Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> and controll the whole City. This ſhows he was no Judge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now will we deal worſe with thee,</hi> &amp;c.] Abuſe thee more than them. For it is the ſame word with <hi>verſe</hi> 7.

               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>Smote the Men with blindneſs.</hi>] Not with a total Blindneſs, (for then they would not have ſought for the Door of
<hi>Lot</hi>'s Houſe, but rather have groped for the way home) but ſuch a Dimneſs that they could not ſee any thing diſtinctly, or in its right place: But there ſeemed to be a Door, ſuppoſe, where there was none: Or, there was ſuch a Confuſion in their Brain, that all things were turned topſie turvy, (as we ſpeak) in their imagination; and appeared quite otherwiſe than they were.</p>

                  <pb n="313" facs="tcp:50230:164"/>Ver. 14. <hi>Which married his Daughters.</hi>] Had eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them for their Wives, but had not yet conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated the Marriage; as ſome underſtand it. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will have it, that, beſides thoſe two Virgin Daughters at home with him, he had other Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who were actually married in the City. Which they gather from the next <hi>Verſe; take thy Wife and two Daughters, which are here:</hi> As if he had more Daughters elſewhere. And <hi>R. Jehuda</hi> (in <hi>Pirke E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſer, c.</hi> 25.) names one of them married to one of the great Men of
<hi>Sodom,</hi> and calls her <hi>Pelothit.</hi> But this ſeems rather to have been the Name of one of them who were ſaved by the Angels, and thence ſo called: For it ſignifies <hi>delivered,</hi> or <hi>ſnatch'd</hi> from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>

                  <hi>He ſeemed as one that mocked.</hi>] Who was not in earneſt; but only made ſport with them, and ſpake in jeſt. For it is the ſame word from whence <hi>Iſaac</hi> is derived, which ſignifies

               <p>
                  <hi>Take thy Wife, and thy two Daughters, which are here.</hi>] Theſe laſt words, <hi>which are here,</hi> are not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>Emphaſis:</hi> And are paraphraſed thus by the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee</hi> Interpreter, <hi>which are found faithful with thee:</hi> Are not corrupted by the common Wickedneſs of this place; or, that believe what we threaten.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Men laid hold upon his hand,</hi> &amp;c.] One of the Angels laid hold upon him and his Wife; and the other upon his two Daughters: Whom they pulled <pb n="314" facs="tcp:50230:165"/> out of the Houſe with ſome kind of conſtraint; and led them out of the City.</p>

               <p>Ver. 18. <hi>And he ſaid unto them,</hi> &amp;c.] Both the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels were ſtill with him: But he ſeems particularly to ſpeak to him that led him and his Wife out of <hi>Sodom;</hi> who had ſpoken before to him, and bid him make haſte, <hi>verſe</hi> 17. But there are thoſe (<hi>Franzius</hi> for inſtance) who would have the word <hi>Adonai</hi> tranſlated not, <hi>my Lord,</hi> but <hi>my Lords,</hi> as if he ſpake to both.</p>
               <p>Ver. 19. <hi>I cannot eſcape to the Mountain,</hi> &amp;c.] He that lingered before, <hi>verſe</hi> 16. now thought he could not make haſte enough. Either being crazy; or, tired with ſitting up all Night; or, fearing the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction would overtake him, before he could reach the Mountain; and deſiring, perhaps, to have a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dwelling than that.</p>

               </p>
               <p>If they referr to <hi>Abraham,</hi> then the meaning is;
<hi>Thou needeſt no other defence of thy Modeſty and Chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than he, nor haſt any reaſon to ſay hereafter, he is thy Brother; for he is ſo dear to God that God will defend him, and he will defend thee, without ſuch ſhifts as this thou haſt uſed: Nay, not only thee, but all that

               <p>Ver. 24. <hi>I will ſwear.</hi>] He was as forward to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm his Promiſes, as to make them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 25. <hi>And Abraham reproved Abimelech.</hi>] But before he ſware, he thought it neceſſary to ſettle a right Underſtanding between them: And therefore argued with <hi>Abimelech</hi> (as it may be rendred) about a Well of Water digged by <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Servants, which
<hi>Abimelech</hi>'s had injuriouſly taken from him. This was Wiſdom to complain of Wrongs now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they entred into a Covenant, that they being redreſſed, there might remain no occaſion of Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels afterward.</p>
               <p>Ver. 26. <hi>Abimelech ſaid, I wot not,</hi> &amp;c.] This is the firſt time I heard of it. If thou hadſt complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, I would have done thee right.</p>
               <p>Ver. 27. <hi>And Abraham took Sheep,</hi> &amp;c.] Some think they were a Preſent he made to <hi>Abimelech;</hi> in gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:50230:176"/> for what he had beſtowed on him, (XX. 14.) or in token of Friendſhip with him. But others think they were deſigned for Sacrifice; by which they made a Covenant one with another. At leaſt, ſome of them ſerved for that uſe.</p>
               <p>Ver. 28. <hi>And he ſet ſeven Ewe-lambs by themſelves.</hi>] The meaning of this is afterwards explained,
<hi>verſe</hi> 30. That though they were part of the Preſent he made him; yet they ſhould be underſtood alſo (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſet apart from the reſt) to be a purchaſe of a quiet poſſeſſion of that Well.</p>
               <p>Ver. 30. <hi>A witneſs unto me that I have digged this Well.</hi>] By this Token it ſhall be remembred here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, that I digged this Well, and that thou didſt grant me quiet poſſeſſion of it.</p>
               <p>Ver. 31. <hi>Called the place Beer-ſheba.</hi>] The
<hi>Hebrew</hi> word <hi>Sheba</hi> ſignifies both an <hi>Oath,</hi> and alſo <hi>ſeven.</hi> Perhaps for both reaſons this Place had this Name. We are ſure for the <hi>firſt,</hi> which is here mentioned: Becauſe they
<hi>ſware</hi> to each other.</p>
               <p>Ver. 32. <hi>Thus they made a Covenant,</hi> &amp;c.] By gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and accepting thoſe Sheep and Oxen, menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned <hi>verſe</hi> 27. and perhaps by offering Sacrifices; or, at leaſt, by eating and drinking together: As <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Abimelech</hi> did in after-times, XXVI.

               <p>Here ſome obſerve it was not unlawful, by the Law of Nature, to make Covenants with Infidels and Idolaters, for mutual Defence and Commerce, or ſuch like reaſons. But I ſee no proof that <hi>Abimelech</hi> was ſuch a Perſon. In future Ages the People of <hi>Canaan</hi> were ſo corrupted by this, as well as other Sins, that God commanded them to be exterminated, and made it unlawful to enter into a Covenant with them,
<hi>Exod.</hi> XXXIV. 15. But as the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> were none
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:50230:177"/> of them: So it ſtill remained lawful to make Leagues with other <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who were not of the <hi>ſeven</hi> Nations of
<hi>Canaan,</hi> as we ſee by the Examples of <hi>David,</hi> and
<hi>Solomon,</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They returned into the Land of the Philiſtines.</hi>] In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that part of the Country, where they dwelt: For both <hi>Abimelech</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> were now in that Land, as appears from the laſt
<hi>Verſe</hi> of this <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 33. <hi>Abraham planted a Grove.</hi>] For a ſolemn and retired Place wherein to worſhip God. For, as <hi>Servius</hi> ſays upon the IX. <hi>Aeneid. Nunquam eſt Lucus ſine Religione.</hi> There never was a Grove, in ancient times, without Religion. And therefore here, we may well ſuppoſe <hi>Abraham</hi> built an Altar: Which was fenced and bounded with an Incloſure, and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with Trees, as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> (<hi>Diſcourſe</hi> XIX.) ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves their <hi>Proſeucha's</hi> or
<hi>Places of Prayer</hi> to have been in after-times. For that this was intended for a <hi>Place of Prayer</hi> appears by the following words, and
<hi>called there on the Name of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>From hence, ſome think, the Cuſtom of planting Groves was derived into all the <hi>Gentile</hi> World: Who ſo prophaned them by Images, and Filthineſs, and Sacrifices to <hi>Daemons,</hi> that God commanded them, by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> to be cut down. But <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> made uſe of a Grove before this, XII. 6, 8. where we find he built an Altar on a Mountain, which I queſtion not was compaſſed with Trees. See XIII. 18. Therefore I take this only to have been the firſt Grove that he planted himſelf.</p>

                  <hi>Called upon the Name of the LORD, the everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God.</hi>] I find that <hi>Maimonides</hi> in ſeveral places, of his <hi>More Nevochim,</hi> tranſlates the laſt words, <hi>The <pb n="339" facs="tcp:50230:177"/> LORD God of the World,</hi> or <hi>the LORD the Almighty Creator of the World.</hi> For this was the great Article of Faith in thoſe Days, That

<hi>Abimelech,</hi> and ſo many conveniencies of Life, that they invited him to ſtay a long time in this Country.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>And Iſaac his Son.</hi>] It is an Enquiry among the

<hi>ſeven and thirty,</hi> whom the <hi>Arabick</hi> Chriſtian Writers follow, <hi>Patricides</hi> and <hi>Elmacinus.

For I find in the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mara Sanhedrim, Cap.</hi> X. <hi>n.</hi> 4. it is ſaid, this fell out a little after he was weaned. See <hi>verſe</hi> 9.</p>

               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>On the third Day.</hi>] It was not much above one Day's journey from <hi>Beerſheba</hi> to <hi>Moriah:</hi> But an Aſs goes ſlowly; eſpecially being loaded, as this was, with a burden of Wood; and with Proviſions, we muſt ſuppoſe, for their Journey: And
<hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Son, and Servants, went on foot, and could not travel far on a Day, (<hi>Iſaac</hi> being but young) for it doth not appear, they had more than one ſingle Aſs, <hi>verſe</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſaw the place afar off.</hi>] It is moſt reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that God had given him ſome Token or Sign, whereby he ſhould know it. And I cannot but think it highly probable, that
<hi>the Divine Glory</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the place, where he was to make the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. Which Conjecture I find confirmed by <hi>R. Elieſer,</hi> among other of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who ſays, That when God bad him go to the place, he would <hi>tell him of,</hi> verſe 2. and there offer his Son; he askt how

<hi>Whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou ſeeſt my Glory, there I will ſtay, and wait for thee,</hi> &amp;c. And accordingly now, <hi>he beheld a Pillar of Fire reaching from Heaven to the Earth,</hi> and thereby knew this was the Place. See
<hi>Pirke Elieſer, c.</hi> 31.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>Go yonder and worſhip.</hi>] This confirms the fore-mentioned Conjecture, That <hi>the Divine Glory</hi> appearing upon the Mountain, he went thither to worſhip God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And come again to you.</hi>] He either ſpeaks of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alone; or, believed God would reſtore <hi>Iſaac</hi> to Life, though he did ſlay him.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>And laid it upon Iſaac his Son.</hi>] A Figure of Chriſt, who carried his own Croſs, <hi>John</hi> XIX. 17. according to the
<hi>Roman</hi> Cuſtom. <hi>Philo</hi>'s Reflection upon <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s carrying the Wood for his own Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is, That <hi>nothing is more laborious than Piety.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>Behold, the Fire and the Wood,</hi> &amp;c.] It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by this, that he had not hitherto acquainted <hi>Iſaac</hi> with his Intention.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>So they went both of them together.</hi>] It ſeems they ſtaid a while, (as they were going toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>verſe</hi> 6.) till
<hi>Iſaac</hi> had finiſhed this Diſcourſe with his Father; and then they proceeded.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>Built an Altar there.</hi>] Of Turf, ſome think; or, of ſuch Stone as he could gather there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And bound Iſaac his Son.</hi>] Both his Hands, and his Feet; as it is explained in <hi>Pirke Elieſer, Cap.</hi> XXXI. When the
<hi>Gentiles</hi> offered humane Sacrifices, they tied both their Hands behind their Backs, as appears from <hi>Ovid, L.</hi> III. <hi>de Pont. Eleg.</hi> 2. and other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors. Whether <hi>Iſaac</hi> was thus bound, it matters not; but we cannot doubt that <hi>Abraham</hi> had now acquainted him with the Will of God, and perſuaded <pb n="344" facs="tcp:50230:180"/> him willingly to comply and ſubmit unto it: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he pre-figured Chriſt the more exactly, who laid
<hi>down his Life of himſelf, and no Man</hi> (without his Conſent)
<hi>could take it from him,</hi> as he ſpeaks, <hi>John</hi> X. 17, 18. We have reaſon to believe this of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> becauſe he being younger and ſtronger could have made reſiſtance, had he been ſo minded.
<hi>Joſephus</hi> ſays he was <hi>twenty five</hi> Years old, <hi>L.</hi> I. <hi>Antiq.</hi> 14. And <hi>Bochartus</hi> makes him <hi>twenty eight;</hi> the word <hi>Naar,</hi> which we tranſlate <hi>Lad,</hi> being uſed for one of that Age; nay, <hi>Joſeph</hi> is called ſo when he was <hi>thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> Years old, <hi>Hierozoic. P.</hi> I. <hi>L.</hi> III. <hi>c.</hi> 9. This is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, That he was old enough to carry ſuch a load of Wood, (<hi>Verſe</hi> 6.) as was ſufficient to make a fire to offer up a Burnt-Offering. There are thoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, who think <hi>Iſaac</hi> was laid upon the Altar to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, in that very Place where Chriſt was crucified. And thus much is true, That though Mount <hi>Calvary</hi> was without
<hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and therefore different from Mount <hi>Moriah,</hi> on which the Temple ſtood: Yet they were ſo near, and it's likely only Parts of one and the ſame Mountain, that they were ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly both comprehended under the Name of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>Abraham ſtretched forth his Hand,</hi> &amp;c.] His Obedience proceeded ſo far, that it evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared he was fully reſolved to do as he was bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den: For the Knife was juſt at

<q rend="inline margSglQuotes">we read that <hi>God tempted Abraham,</hi> and bad him go and offer to him his Son: But here the <hi>Angel of the LORD</hi> called to him and bad him not to do it. What is the meaning of this? Will they (whoſe Opinion he there oppoſes) ſay that <hi>God</hi> commanded
<hi>Iſaac</hi> to be ſlain, and that his <hi>Angel</hi> forbad it: And that
<hi>Abraham</hi> obeyed the Angel who bad him ſpare his Son, againſt the Command of God, who bad him ſlay him? This Sence is ridiculous and not to be endured.

14. <hi>p.</hi> 556, &amp;c. Certain it is that <hi>Abraham</hi> was now an
<hi>hundred and forty</hi> Years old: For he was an <hi>hundred</hi> when

O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers therefore follow the Opinion of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors, which is this, in ſhort; <hi>Before the giving of the Law, the ancient Fathers ſwore by the Covenant of Circumciſion.</hi> They are the words of

And it is not improbable that this <pb n="362" facs="tcp:50230:189"/> manner of Swearing, by putting the Hand under that part which was the ſubject of Circumciſion, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Covenant God made with that Family, and their right to accompliſh the Promiſe of the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> But this was not a Cuſtom peculiar to
<hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family, for we find it among other <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern</hi> People: And therefore, it is likely, more anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent than Circumciſion. For which Cauſe, <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> himſelf, thinks putting the Hand under the Thigh, was a Token of Subjection and Homage, done by a Servant to his Lord: He ſitting, and the Servant putting his Hand under him. <hi>Grotius</hi> imagines, that the Sword hanging upon the Thigh, (<hi>Pſalm</hi> XLV. 3.) this was as much as to ſay, <hi>If I falſifie, kill me.</hi> Which is very witty; but the other ſeems plainer; ſignifying as much as, <hi>I am under thy power, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to do what thou commandeſt.</hi>

<hi>Abimelech;</hi> as appears from the Story of <hi>David:</hi> Who fled to one of that Name called <hi>Achiſh</hi> in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> XXI. 10. but
<hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech</hi> in the Title of the XXXIV <hi>Pſalm.</hi> See

               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>And</hi> (or <hi>for</hi>) <hi>the LORD appeared to him.</hi>] He intended to have gone into <hi>Egypt,</hi> as <hi>Abraham</hi> his Father had done in the like Caſe, XII. 10.

               <p>Though <hi>Egypt</hi> was a moſt plentiful Country; yet the King of it at this time, was not ſo good a Man, perhaps, as him that reigned in the Days of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi>

<hi>Abarbinel:</hi> Who, by <hi>Commandments,</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands not only that of Circumciſion, but of expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>Iſhmael:</hi> And by

               </p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>And Iſaac dwelt in Gerar.</hi>] This is a freſh Inſtance of his conſtant Obedience; in truſting to God's Providence here, and not going down into <hi>Egypt,</hi> as he was inclined.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>She is my Siſter.</hi>] Or, <hi>Couſin;</hi> for ſo ſhe was. He told part of the Truth, but not all.</p>

               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>Sporting with Rebekah his Wife.</hi>] Uſing ſuch familiarity with her, and blandiſhments, as were not allowable between Brethren and Siſters; but common between Man and Wife, even openly. As embracing her in his Arms, and kiſſing her, perhaps, very often: He having an exceeding great love to her, XXIV. 67.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>Of a ſurety, ſhe is thy Wife.</hi>] It ſeems he took <hi>Iſaac</hi> to be ſo good a Man, that he lookt upon the Liberties he took with <hi>Rebekah,</hi> as tokens of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal Love, not of inceſtuous Deſires.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>Brought guiltineſs upon us.</hi>] It is likely the Puniſhment inflicted upon his Father and Family, (XX. 17.) only for taking <hi>Sarah</hi> into his Houſe, with an intention to make her his Wife, was yet in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory among them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>He that toucheth this Man or his Wife,</hi> &amp;c.] This looks like a modeſt word, as it is uſed, XX. 6. and 1

But it ſeems more likely to me, that the Dearth was at an end: For it is ſaid <hi>Verſe</hi> 8. that he had been in that Country <hi>a long time,</hi> when <hi>Abimelech</hi> ſaw him ſporting with his Wife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An hundred fold.</hi>] This, in it ſelf, is not wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; though, at this time, it was a ſingular Bleſſing of God, after there had been ſome time ago a dearth; and, perhaps, the Soil not rich, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded ſo large a crop.

               <p>
                  <hi>And the LORD bleſſed him.</hi>] Or, <hi>for</hi> the LORD bleſſed him. This is the reaſon of the fruitfulneſs of that Soil; which naturally would not have yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo much.</p>

                  <pb n="396" facs="tcp:50230:206"/>Ver. 13. <hi>And the Man waxed great,</hi> &amp;c.] I ſuppoſe he had many ſuch friutful Years; ſo that his Riches increaſed till he grew <hi>very great,</hi> and bought more Cattle than he had before.

               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>Thou art much mightier than we.</hi>] As the People envied him, <hi>verſe</hi> 14. ſo the King himſelf, it ſeems, began to fear him. And therefore deſired him, in a friendly manner, to leave his Country. For they were not yet grown ſo wicked, as to attempt to deſtroy thoſe who lived quietly among them; when they apprehended they would become richer and ſtronger than themſelves.</p>
               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>The Valley of Gerar.</hi>] Where that was, is uncertain; but at ſome diſtance from the City where <hi>Abimelech</hi> dwelt, and near to which <hi>Iſaac</hi> had inhabited before.</p>
               <p>Ver. 18. <hi>Which they had digged in the days of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi>] He choſe to open the old ones, rather than dig new; both becauſe he was certain there to find <pb n="397" facs="tcp:50230:206"/> a Spring of Water, and becauſe it was moſt eaſie, and leſs obnoxious to Cenſure or Envy: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would preſerve his Father's Memory; for which reaſon he did not give them new Names, but thoſe they had in his Father's Days.</p>
               <p>Ver. 19. <hi>They digged in the Valley,</hi> &amp;c.] In pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of time, they found a neceſſity of more Water; and ſo digged till they met with a new Spring, in the Valley.</p>
               <p>Ver. 20. <hi>The Water is ours.</hi>] Becauſe it was found in their Soil, as <hi>Menochius</hi> obſerves. But they having let the Ground to
<hi>Iſaac,</hi> the Water was truly his, as long as the Contract laſted.</p>
               <p>Ver. 21. <hi>And they digged another Well.</hi>] I ſuppoſe in the ſame Valley: For rather than contend, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded from his right in the other Well.</p>
               <p>Ver. 22. <hi>He removed from thence.</hi>] To avoid ſtrife, he quitted that part of the Country, and went to another: Where he was not diſturbed in his Paſturage.</p>

<hi>Jacob,</hi> as was noted before. One may rather ſay, theſe were Garments belonging to him, as Heir of the Family: Between whom and the other Sons, it's very probable the Affection of Parents was wont to make ſome difference in their Apparel.</p>

               <p>Ver. 27. <hi>He ſmelled the ſmell of his Raiment.</hi>] As he embraced him, he perceived the fragrancy of his Garments: Which he could not before, while he ſtood remote; his Senſes being weak and dull. The

               <p>This is infinitely more ſolid, than the Conceit of almoſt all the ancient <hi>Rabbins,</hi> that God repreſented in this Ladder, the
<hi>riſe,</hi> and the <hi>fall</hi> of the <hi>four</hi> great
<hi>Monarchies.</hi> For where is there any mention in this Dream of
<hi>four</hi> Angels? Or, of <hi>ſeventy</hi> Steps repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the
<hi>ſeventy</hi> Years Captivity in <hi>Babylon?</hi> Or, of <hi>two and fifty</hi> Steps repreſenting the time of the Reign of the <hi>four</hi> Kings of <hi>Perſia</hi> and <hi>Media,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their computation? &amp;c. All this is the pure invention of idle Men, who dream upon the Holy Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>And behold, the LORD ſtood above it.</hi>] Finally, he ſaw the <hi>Divine Majeſty,</hi> or <hi>Glory,</hi> (ſo the
<hi>Targum</hi> here expounds it) as the unmovable Mover <pb n="412" facs="tcp:50230:214"/> of all things. From whom all comes as the firſt Cauſe, and to whom all returns, as the laſt End.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I am the LORD God,</hi> &amp;c.] This is the firſt time that we read of God's appearing to <hi>Jacob:</hi> And it was only in a Dream. But it made ſuch a deep im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon him, that he doubted not of the Truth of what was now expreſly promiſed him by God himſelf; that he ſhould have the <hi>bleſſing of Abraham,</hi> as his Father had told him,
<hi>verſe</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>Behold, I am with thee.</hi>] Or, will be with thee, <hi>i. e.</hi> My peculiar Providence ſhall be over thee, and take Care of thy ſafety, as <hi>Maimonides</hi> well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds it; in his <hi>More Nevoch. P.</hi> III. <hi>cap.</hi> 18.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will not leave thee,</hi> &amp;c.] This ſhows the intent of the Dream was to comfort <hi>Jacob,</hi> in his ſolitary and poor Condition, by an aſſurance that God's watchful Providence ſhould attend him, till he had accompliſhed all his Promiſes to him.</p>
               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>Surely the LORD is in this place.</hi>] By his ſpecial extraordinary Preſence: For here he had manifeſted himſelf to him, and given him ſingular Aſſurances of his Favour; and that the very firſt Night, after he went from home: Which made this place more acceptable to him than his Father's Houſe. For now he was become a Prophet, as
<hi>Maimonides</hi> obſerves, <hi>More Nevoch. P.</hi> II. <hi>cap.</hi> 45. where he ſays, That they who Propheſie in a Dream, do not call it a Dream after Prophecy is come to them in a Dream, but ſimply ſay, it was a Prophecy. Thus the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch <hi>Jacob,</hi> after he awakned out of his Prophetick Dream, (wherein he heard the LORD ſpeak to him, <hi>verſe</hi>
13, 14.) he doth not call it a Dream, but roundly ſays, <hi>Surely the LORD is in this place,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>This is none other but the Houſe of God.</hi>] The

               <p>
                  <hi>And this is the Gate of Heaven.</hi>] Here God keeps his Court, attended by his Holy Angels: Whom he had ſeen come from Heaven hither, and go up from hence thither. So Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> explains it, <hi>Book</hi> II. <hi>p.</hi> 436. The Preſence of God in one Place more than another, conſiſts in his <hi>Train</hi> or <hi>Retinue.</hi> A King is there, where his Court is: And ſo God is there <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially preſent,</hi> where the Angels keep their Station. Which is the meaning of the <hi>Gate of Heaven,</hi> i. e. Heaven's Court: For the <hi>Gate</hi> was wont to be the Judgment-Hall, and the Place where Kings, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators uſed to ſit, attended by their Guards and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters.</p>

               <p>This, I think, we may certainly conclude from this place, That
<hi>Jacob,</hi> the Grand-Child of <hi>Abraham,</hi> vowing the Tenth of
<hi>all,</hi> as <hi>Abraham</hi> had given the Tenth of the <hi>Spoil,</hi> he was induced to it, by the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, which was then among Religious People.

So that it was lookt upon as the moſt perfect of all other; and accordingly had in great regard.

Whom he could not hope ſo readily to diſpoſe in Marriage, as <hi>Rachel;</hi> becauſe ſhe was homely.</p>

               <p>Ver. 26. <hi>It muſt not be ſo done in our Country,</hi> &amp;c.] We do not read of any ſuch ancient Cuſtom: And therefore this ſeems a mere ſhift, or a jeſt. Or, if it had been true, he ſhould have told it <hi>Jacob</hi> before-hand.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Marriages are to be celebrated, according to Cuſtom, by a ſeven Day's Feaſt: Compleat this Marriage thou haſt begun with</hi> Leah,

               </p>
               <p>Ver. 30. <hi>And ſerved with him yet other ſeven Years.</hi>] After he had ſolemnly married <hi>Rachel,</hi> and bedded her, (as we ſpeak) for that he did, <hi>ſeven</hi> Days after his Marriage with
<hi>Leah</hi> was accompliſhed. So this <hi>Verſe</hi> begins, <hi>And he went in alſo unto Rachel,</hi> and then began his other <hi>ſeven</hi> Years Service. There was no poſitive Law, as yet, againſt ſuch Marriages as this, (with two Siſters) which were afterwards expreſly condemned: But at preſent indulged; as the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of a Man's own Siſter was in the beginning of the World. Whence that ſaying of the <hi>Jews</hi> in the
<hi>Gemara Hieroſol.</hi> upon the Title <hi>Sanhedrim, The World was built by Indulgence.</hi> And <hi>Jacob,</hi> it is very likely, thought there was an unavoidable neceſſity for his marrying theſe two Siſters. For
<hi>Rachel</hi> was his true Wife; <hi>Leah</hi> being impoſed upon him by a Cheat. But, having known her, he concluded he could not honeſtly leave her; no more than he could <hi>Rachel,</hi> to whom he was firſt contracted.</p>
               <p>Ver. 31. <hi>Leah was hated.</hi>] Comparatively, not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely. For <hi>Leah</hi> having joyned with her Father to deceive him, he could not love her ſo well as <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel;</hi> to whom he had engaged his firſt Affection.</p>
               <p>Ver. 32. <hi>Reuben.</hi>] The Name of this Son, and of all the reſt that follow, are derived from the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue: Which ſhows that <hi>Laban</hi>'s Family ſpake the ſame Language with

<hi>Rachel</hi>'s envy at her ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo many Children, when ſhe her ſelf had none; made her contrive ways to keep him from <hi>Leah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>Thou muſt come in to me,</hi> &amp;c.] I cannot think of any good Reaſon, either of this Contention among <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Wives for his Company, or their gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him their <hi>Maids</hi> to be his Wives, or for <hi>Moſes</hi> his taking ſuch particular notice of all this; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the earneſt Deſire they had to fulfil the Promiſe made to
<hi>Abraham,</hi> That his Seed ſhould be as the Stars of Heaven for Multitude; and that in one Seed of his (the <hi>Meſſiah</hi>) all the Nations of the Earth ſhould be bleſſed. It had been below the Dignity of ſuch a Sacred Hiſtory, as this is, to relate ſuch things, if there had not been ſomething of great Conſideration in them. And what can that be, but chiefly the Birth of the <hi>bleſſed Seed;</hi> which was the Object of the Hopes of all pious People in thoſe Days. For it is evident, both by
<hi>Rachel</hi> and her Siſter, that it was Children they deſired, and not merely the Company of their Husbands: As it here follows, <hi>verſe</hi>

               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>God hearkned to Leah.</hi>] To her earneſt Prayer, or vehement Deſire: And gave her another Son.</p>

               <p>Ver. 19. <hi>Conceived again.</hi>] The birth of this Son begat a greater Kindneſs between them; and made him leſs a ſtranger to her Bed.</p>

               <p>Ver. 34. <hi>I would it might be according to thy word.</hi>] He thought this ſo good a Bargain, that he was afraid <hi>Jacob</hi> would not ſtand to it.</p>

<hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi>'s Sons, who were now grown up: Though, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, when
<hi>Jacob</hi> firſt came to him, they were ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle as not to be able to look after the Flocks; which his Daughter therefore fed, XXIX. 9. As for
<hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>'s Sons, the eldeſt of them was ſcarce <hi>ſeven</hi> Years old; and therefore could not be fit for ſuch Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.
<hi>Laban</hi> therefore went and ſeparated the <hi>ſpotted</hi> Cattle from the reſt; and then, leſt <hi>Jacob</hi> ſhould get any of them to mix with thoſe of one Colour, he committed them to his own Sons, to be fed apart by themſelves. And, as it follows in the next <hi>Verſe,</hi> made a diſtance of <hi>three days journey,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the one and the other; that none might be in danger to ſtray to the Flock which was fed by
<hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob:</hi> Unto whoſe Care were committed all that had no Spots at all.</p>
               <p>Ver. 36. <hi>Set three days journey,</hi> &amp;c.] That they might be ſure, not to come near, ſo much as to ſee one another.</p>

                  <hi>And pilled white ſtrakes in them.</hi>] He had
<hi>three</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices to compaſs his end. The firſt was this, To peel off the Bark from the Rods, at certain diſtances, till the white appeared between the Bark, which was of a different Colour. And theſe Rods, thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coloured, he laid in the Channels of Water, at that time when the Cattle were wont to couple, (as it follows in the next <hi>Verſe</hi>) that their Fancies might be painted with ſuch divers Colours, as they ſaw in the Rods. See <hi>verſe</hi> 40, 41.</p>
               <p>Ver. 39. <hi>And the Flocks conceived before the Rods, and brought forth,</hi> &amp;c.] The <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers aſcribe this to the miraculous Operation of God, as <hi>Bochart</hi> obſerves in his
<hi>Hierozoic. P.</hi> I. <hi>L.</hi> II. <hi>cap.</hi> 49. But the
<hi>Latin</hi> Fathers, particularly St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> look upon it as done by the natural Operation of the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For which he alledges the like thing done in <hi>Spain</hi> among Horſes and Mares: And brings
<hi>Quincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates</hi> to juſtifie the like Conceptions in Women. Which he backs with a great Number of Authorities, out of
<hi>Galen</hi> and other Writers: Who have obſerved indelible Marks, to have been impreſſed upon Children, by the Objects that were preſented to their Mother's Imagination, at the time of her Conception.</p>
               <p>And St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſays the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> by the like De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice with this of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s, had ſtill a new <hi>Apis,</hi> or
<hi>Pied-Bull,</hi> to ſucceed that which died: To whom they gave Divine Honour. But whatſoever Power there might be in natural Imagination to produce ſuch Effects, it muſt be acknowledged that God gave an
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:50230:224"/> extraordinary Bleſſing to this Contrivance: As ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Viſion which <hi>Jacob</hi> ſays he had, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God (who had directed him to this Invention) promiſed to give it ſucceſs, XXXI.
10, 11, 12. For Beaſts have very rarely ſuch a ſtrong and vehement Imagination, as produces ſuch Effects; unleſs it be moved by ſome unuſual Paſſion. And therefore we muſt confeſs that God excited and ſtirred up their Imagination; which otherways would not have wrought in that manner; at leaſt, not in all the Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. For, let any Shepherd now try this Device, and he will not find it do, what it did then by a Divine Operation.

               <p>Ver. 40. <hi>And Jacob did ſeparate the Lambs,</hi> &amp;c.] One <hi>Species</hi> is put for all: And the meaning is, That thoſe young Cattle (whether Lambs, or Kids of the Goats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) which were thus brought forth ſpotted, he did not ſuffer to remain with the Flock of
<hi>Laban;</hi> leſt he ſhould ſay that he did him wrong by letting them mix together, and ſo bring forth ſpotted Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, (and perhaps he might alſo think that they look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon <hi>Laban</hi>'s one-coloured Cattle, might bring forth young ones like to them.) But, inſtead of this way of inriching himſelf, he had a <hi>ſecond</hi> Artifice; which was to put the ſpotted Cattle (produced by the former Device) foremoſt: So that
<hi>Laban</hi>'s Flock ſhould always look upon them, and thereby be the more apt to conceive the like. And then it follows, in the end of this
<hi>Verſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He put his own Flocks by themſelves, and put them not to Laban's Cattle.</hi>] Which looks like a repetition of what was ſaid in the beginning of the <hi>Verſe:</hi> But the meaning is, That thoſe which brought forth <pb n="433" facs="tcp:50230:224"/> ſpotted, by this ſecond Artifice, he alſo put by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and ſuffered them not to be mingled with
<hi>Laban</hi>'s Cattle: As before he had ſeparated thoſe that were brought
<hi>forth</hi> ſpotted, by looking upon the Rods.</p>
               <p>Ver. 41. <hi>And it came to paſs, when the ſtronger Cattle did conceive, that Jacob,</hi> &amp;c.] This was his <hi>third</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice: Which is thus expounded by the <hi>Chaldee</hi> and a great number of other Authors, (which may be ſeen in <hi>Bochart, P.</hi> I. <hi>Hierozoic. L.</hi> II. <hi>cap.</hi> 46.) that he laid the Rods before the Cattle only in the Spring-time, when the Sun was aſcending, and the Cattle luſty and vigorous: But let them alone when the Cattle came together in <hi>September,</hi> or the declenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Year, (for they bred twice a Year in thoſe Countries) at which time they were become more feeble. If he had always laid the Rods before the Cattle, there might have been none but <hi>ſpotted,</hi> and ſo
<hi>Laban</hi> have been quite impoveriſhed. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he choſe to do it only in their firſt and prime Copulation, which was in the Spring-time: And o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it in the latter, which was in the Autumn. Our famous Mr.
<hi>Mede</hi> follows this Interpretation, <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> XLV.
<hi>p.</hi> 355. But there is no certainty in it: For <hi>Pliny</hi> and
<hi>Columella</hi> preferr theſe begot in Autumn, to thoſe begot in the Spring. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Tranſlation is moſt proper, which repreſents
<hi>Jacob,</hi> as uſing this Artifice, of laying the Rods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, only when the ſtronger Cattle came toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and not when the weaker. And ſo the LXX underſtood the words, without reſpect to the former or latter breed: And ſo the <hi>Hebrew</hi> words import, as <hi>Bochartus</hi> ſhows in the place before-named, <hi>pag.</hi> 514.</p>

But, as what was not directly againſt the Contract, may be thought to be allowed by it; ſo it is certain that <hi>Jacob</hi> might lawfully take what God beſtowed upon him: Who ſeems to have directed him by an Angel to uſe this Artifice; or, at leaſt, teſtified his Approbation of it: Intending to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer unto
<hi>Jacob</hi> the Wealth of <hi>Laban,</hi> as he gave the Riches of the

And in like manner, every half Year, when the Ews brought forth young ones (which they did twice a Year) and he ſaw them ſpotted; he broke his Contract, and made a new one, leſs advantageous to <hi>Jacob:</hi> Sometimes reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to one ſort of Cattle, ſometimes to another: And not letting him have the whole benefit of his Contract.

For up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſerious Conſideration of all the Circumſtances, this Viſion, here mentioned, ſeems to me to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from what was repreſented by an Angel in a Dream,
<hi>verſe</hi> 11. For he had <hi>that</hi> it is evident, at the beginning of his laſt <hi>ſix</hi> Years Service; <hi>this,</hi> at the concluſion of them: But he puts them both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, becauſe they belong to the ſame matter.</p>
               <p>And God now remembers his <hi>Vow,</hi> to ſhow him that he was well-pleaſed with it; and to excite him to perform it, when he had brought him (as he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures him he would) to that place again.</p>

And for this reaſon, they think, <hi>Rachel</hi> ſtole them, that <hi>Laban</hi> might not enquire by them, which way <hi>Jacob</hi> and his Family were gone. <hi>Hottinger</hi> alſo hath many ingenious Arguments to prove, that they were the ſame with the Arabian <hi>Taliſmans,</hi> in after-times: Which were Images made under ſuch or ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellations, to receive the heavenly Influences: Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be a Phylactery, or an Oracle.

               <p>But the Conjecture of <hi>Lud. de Dieu</hi> upon this place, ſeems to me far more probable, that they were the Repreſentations of ſome Angelical Powers, (<hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphim</hi> and <hi>Seraphim</hi> being the very ſame, by the change only of a Letter) who, they imagined, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the Mind of God, by them. For, in thoſe <pb n="441" facs="tcp:50230:228"/> Countries where the
<hi>SCHECHINAH,</hi> or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the <hi>Divine Majeſty</hi> did not appear, as it did in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family, they had at leaſt ſome Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, and of the Angels that were its Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants: The reſemblance of which they made, in hope they might by that means have a Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with them, and gain Intelligence from Heaven. Of which, evil Spirits made their Advantage; and abuſed Mankind by the lying Anſwers they gave to their Enquiries. For there is no reaſon to think that God allowed, much leſs appointed the making of theſe <hi>Teraphim:</hi> Which
<hi>Gaffarel</hi> adventures to ſay, were Piouſly uſed before the Law of
<hi>Moſes,</hi> and God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted his Mind and Will by them. This had been to lead Men into Idolatry, by Image-worſhip: Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which they were too prone of themſelves.</p>
               <p>Expoſitors differ very much about <hi>Rachel</hi>'s Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in ſtealing them. Some fanſie, ſhe ſtill retained a tang of Superſtition: But I take it to be more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that <hi>Jacob,</hi> who loved her extreamly, and was no leſs beloved by her, had brought her off from the falſe Notions and bad Cuſtoms of her Country. And then ſhe did not carry them away, for fear <hi>Laban</hi> ſhould enquire by them, which way they were gone: (for ſhe knew they were but vain Idols, which could give no Direction) But, rather deſigned to convince her Father of his Superſtition; by letting him ſee, that his <hi>Gods</hi> (as he called them) could not preſerve themſelves, much leſs do any ſervice to him. Or, perhaps, ſhe intended to give her ſelf ſome Portion of his Goods, which ſhe thought juſtly belonged to her: And ſo took theſe <hi>Teraphim,</hi> which were of ſome value (though ſmall Images) becauſe they are generally ſuppoſed to have been made of Silver.</p>

               <p>Ver. 23. <hi>And he took them, and ſent them over,</hi> &amp;c.] Having tried the Ford, he returned; and cauſed them all to paſs over: And ſo (as it follows) <hi>was left alone,</hi> on the

               <p>Ver. 24. <hi>And there wreſtled a Man with him.</hi>] He ſtaid alone, in all likelihood, that he might commend himſelf and his Family to God, by earneſt Prayer: Which ſeems to be confirmed by the Prophet <hi>Hoſea,</hi> XII. 4. And as he was Praying, or when he had done, a Man encountred him, with whom he gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled; taking him, perhaps, for ſome of
<hi>Eſau</hi>'s Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants come to ſurpriſe him. For it was ſo dark, that he could not ſee what kind of Countenance he had: Or, if he could, Angels were wont to appear ſo like to Men, that at the firſt they did not diſcern the difference. <hi>Maimonides</hi> fanſies all this was done in a Prophetick Viſion. <hi>More Nevoch. P.</hi> II. <hi>cap.</hi> 42. but the whole Narration confutes this. The only queſtion is, whether this was a created Angel, or the Eternal ΛΟΓΟΣ, as many of the ancient Fathers underſtood it. Whoſe Opinion is oppoſed by St.
<hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin,</hi> (as I obſerved upon the XVIII <hi>Chapter</hi>) and ſeems to me not ſo probable, as that this Angel was one of <hi>God's Hoſt,</hi> mentioned <hi>verſe</hi> 2. ſent from the <hi>SCHECHINAH,</hi> or <hi>Divine Majeſty:</hi> By whoſe Order, and in whoſe Preſence, he ſtrove with <hi>Jacob,</hi> in ſuch manner, as is here deſcribed.

<pb n="456" facs="tcp:50230:236"/> 
                  <hi>Angels of the Preſence;</hi> that wait continually upon the <hi>Divine Majeſty,</hi> and make a part of his Retinue. See XXXV.

               <p>Ver. 25. <hi>And when he ſaw that he prevailed not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.</hi>] Though <hi>Jacob,</hi> no doubt, was extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily ſtrengthned by God, in this Combat, (<hi>Hoſea</hi> XII. 5.) yet the Angel who repreſented God, could have prevailed againſt him, if his Orders had not been to let <hi>Jacob</hi> have the better.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He touched the hollow of his Thigh.</hi>] The Angel gave over the Combat; but made him know, by this light touch, what he could have done, if he had pleaſed, <hi>i. e.</hi> quite overthrown him, as eaſily as he made him go limping. This diſcovered to <hi>Jacob</hi> that he was more than a Man, who wreſtled with him: And that he had not prevailed againſt him by his own Strength; but by the Power of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The hallow of Jacob's Thigh was out of joynt.</hi>] The Thigh-Bone ſlipt out of the Cavity, or Socket, into which it was inſerted.</p>
               <p>Ver. 26. <hi>And he ſaid, Let me go.</hi>] Though the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel ceaſed to wreſtle any longer, yet <hi>Jacob</hi> would not let go his hold: And, the more to ſet off his Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the Angel ſeems not to be able to break from him, without his Conſent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For the Day breaks.</hi>] It is time for thee to follow thy Family over the Brook.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he ſaid, I will not let thee go, except thou bleſs me.</hi>] By this it plainly appears, <hi>Jacob</hi> began to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand who he was.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>For as a Prince haſt thou power with God, and with Men.</hi>] Theſe words explain the End and Intention of this Combat; which was to ſhow, That he having ſuch Power with God, as to prevail over one of his Miniſters, needed not fear his Brother <hi>Eſau.</hi> So the <hi>Vulgar Latin</hi> expreſſes it, <hi>If thou haſt been ſtrong againſt God, how much more ſhalt thou prevail with Men?</hi> And it is the Sence of our Tranſlation, which more lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally renders the <hi>Hebrew</hi> words,
<hi>Thou haſt behaved thy ſelf like a Prince</hi> (ſo the word
<hi>Scharitha</hi> imports) <hi>with God, and with Men,</hi> &amp;c. That is, haſt ſhowed ſuch an Heroick Spirit (as we ſpeak) in this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, that thou needeſt not fear <hi>Eſau</hi> and all his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers. This Victory is an aſſurance that thou ſhalt get the better of him.</p>
               <p>There is no Body skilled in the Original Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, but eaſily ſees no other Derivation of the Name of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is to be ſought for, but what is contained in this word <hi>Scharitha:</hi> Which gives the reaſon of it. For <hi>Sar,</hi> as St. <hi>Hierom</hi> obſerves, ſignifies a <hi>Prince;</hi> and the <hi>Jod</hi> in the beginning, is the common note of a proper Name. So the meaning of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is as much as a <hi>Prince with God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 29. <hi>Jacob askt him and ſaid, Tell me, I pray thee, thy Name.</hi>] <hi>Jacob</hi> having told him his own Name, deſires him to requite him in the ſame kind: That thereby he might more certainly know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was an Angel or a Man. For theſe words <pb n="458" facs="tcp:50230:237"/> ſeem to demonſtrate, he did not think him, to be God himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wherefore doſt thou ask after my Name?</hi>] Do not enquire after it. <hi>Raſi</hi> thinks Angels changed their Names according to the Offices and Functions to which they were aſſigned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he bleſſed him there.</hi>] Renewed the Bleſſing which God had promiſed to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed: Whereby
<hi>Jacob</hi> was fully ſatisfied who he was. For he pronounced this Bleſſing in the Name of God, from whom he came.</p>
               <p>Ver. 30. <hi>I have ſeen God face to face.</hi>] Been admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the neareſt Familiarity with him. For he lookt upon this Angel, as a part of the <hi>SCHECHI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAH;</hi> which now alſo, it's likely, viſibly appeared, and made him call this Place <hi>Peniel, the Face of God.</hi> Which doth not import that the <hi>SCHECHINAH</hi> appeared in an humane Figure, (for it never did) but that he lookt upon it as a Token of the Divine Preſence, and that it approached very near him; as when one Friend ſpeaks to another
<hi>face to face,</hi> as the ancient Phraſe was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And my life is preſerved.</hi>] This is commonly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted by the Opinion, which was in old time, that if they ſaw one of the heavenly Miniſters, they were to be no longer Men of this World, but die preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But it may referr (as <hi>Menochius</hi> obſerves) to the principal Scope of the Combat, which was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm <hi>Jacob</hi> againſt the fear of <hi>Eſau:</hi> And ſo the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, <hi>I doubt not, I am ſafe; God will preſerve me from any hurt by Eſau.</hi>

<hi>Hebrew</hi> Text (as <hi>fourteen</hi> other words in the <hi>Bible</hi> are) with <hi>four</hi> unuſual Points over it: To denote, as the
<hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Doctors think, ſome remarkable thing; which ſome of them take to be, the ſincerity of <hi>Eſau</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation to his Brother. And truly, if he hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pardoned the Injury, which he conceived
<hi>Jacob</hi> had done him, it is much to be noted; and ought to be lookt upon as a ſign he was become a good Man. And ſo <hi>Mart. Bucer</hi> I remember underſtood it, in his Commentaries upon the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans:</hi> Where he makes this an Argument that <hi>Eſau</hi> was not a Reprobate, as ſome are apt to imagine. If it be ſaid that God deterred him from doing his Brother any hurt, it is more than can be proved. For it is recorded indeed that God threatned <hi>Laban</hi> in ſuch a manner, that he durſt not meddle with him: But no ſuch thing is ſaid of <hi>Eſau;</hi> though it would have been of more concern to have recorded the ſame here, if <hi>Moſes</hi> had known of any ſuch Divine Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition to him.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>Joſeph and Rachel.</hi>] The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors here obſerve, that <hi>Joſeph</hi> goes before his Mother; but the Mothers of all the reſt went before their Children: Of which, I think, it is not needful to ſeek a reaſon. For it is likely <hi>Moſes</hi> did not take care to place his words exactly. Or, if he did, no more ought to be made of it than this; that <hi>Joſeph</hi> being a goodly Child, his Mother put him before her; as we commonly do, when we would ſhow a Child to advantage. Or, he being very young and a forward <pb n="461" facs="tcp:50230:238"/> Child, ſtept before his Mother; as Children are wont to do, when ſome fine ſhow appears which they ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly deſire to behold.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>What meaneſt thou by all this drove?</hi> &amp;c.] The Servants, no doubt, had told him, (as their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter had ordered, XXXII.
17, &amp;c.) but he asks <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> that he might have an opportunity to declare how little he needed or deſired ſuch a Preſent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theſe are to find grace in the ſight of my Lord.</hi>] To teſtifie my Reſpect to thee, that I may obtain thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Good-will towards me. For Inferiors were wont to approach to their Superiors with Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, to make themſelves the more kindly accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And it is obſervable, that as he and all his made ſuch Obeyſance to
<hi>Eſau,</hi> as ſignified he was his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, (as he calls himſelf,
<hi>verſe</hi> 5.) ſo he ſtill Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours <hi>Eſau</hi> by the Name of
<hi>his Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>I have enough, my Brother,</hi> &amp;c.] In this he ſhows himſelf not to be of a covetous Humour: But as free from that Vice, as from Revenge.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>If I have found grace in thy ſight.</hi>] If thou loveſt me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As though I had ſeen the face of God.</hi>] For
<hi>Eſau</hi>'s kind Reception of him, he could not but look upon as a Token of the Divine Favour towards him. Some think by <hi>God</hi> may be meant an Angel, or great Man: Into whoſe preſence, Inferiors, as I ſaid, were wont to approach with Preſents.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And thou waſt pleaſed with me.</hi>] Received me kindly.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>Take my Bleſſing.</hi>] <hi>i. e.</hi> My Preſent, as we expound it in the Margin of 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> XXV. 27.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I have enough.</hi>] It is a larger word in the
<hi>Hebrew,</hi> than that uſed by <hi>Eſau, verſe</hi> 9. ſignifying that he had enough to ſpare of all ſorts of things: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:50230:239"/> 
                  <hi>Eſau</hi> need not fear his impoveriſhment, by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting this Preſent.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>And he ſaid, Let us take our journey,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>Eſau</hi> invites him to go along with him, to the Land of

Or, <hi>Jacob</hi> was hindred, perhaps, by ſomething which he could not foreſee, from performing this Promiſe to his Brother: Of which, no doubt, he gave him an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that he might not be thought to break his word.</p>
               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>Let me now leave with thee,</hi> &amp;c.] He would have left ſome of his Followers with <hi>Jacob,</hi> to ſhow him the way, and to be a Guard to him; or honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably attend him.</p>

<hi>Hebrews</hi> generally underſtand the word <hi>Shalem</hi>) to that City called <hi>Schechem.</hi> And it may referr either to the ſoundneſs of his Leg; which was perfectly well, ſo that he halted no longer: Or, to the ſafety of his Perſon; in that he was not at all hurt by <hi>Eſau:</hi> Or, rather, to the ſafety of every thing he had; no evil accident having befallen him, of any ſort, ſince he left <hi>Laban.</hi> Which is the rather now mentioned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the next <hi>Chapter Moſes</hi> gives a relation of a very ſad misfortune, which befel his Family.</p>

               <p>Ver. 1. <hi>AND God ſaid unto Jacob.</hi>] There were ſeveral ways, as <hi>Maimonides</hi> obſerves, whereby God communicated himſelf unto the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. Unto whom he is ſaid, ſometimes, to ſpeak by an Angel in a Dream, as he did to <hi>Jacob,</hi> XXXI. 11. Sometimes by an Angel, without any mention how it was, whether in a Dream or Viſion, or not: Of which he takes this place to be an Inſtance; and <hi>Verſe</hi> the 10th of this <hi>Chapter,</hi> and XXII. 15. <hi>Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> In other places there is no mention of an Angel, but of God alone ſpeaking; yet in a Viſion, or Dream, XV. <hi>I.</hi> And, <hi>Laſtly,</hi> God is ſaid to ſpeak ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, neither in a Dream, nor Viſion, nor by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, XII. 1. XXXI. 3. <hi>More Nevochim, P.</hi> II. <hi>cap.</hi> 42. In which Claſſis, I think he might have put this Apa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition to <hi>Jacob,</hi> as well as that laſt mentioned: For there is no difference between them, but this; That in the former place (XXXI. 3.) it is ſaid, <hi>The LORD ſaid unto Jacob;</hi> and here, <hi>God ſaid unto Jacob.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ariſe, go up to Bethel, and dwell there.</hi>] By this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice God ſhowed, he ſtill took Care of him; and delivered him from the Fear he was in of the <hi>Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi> and <hi>Perizzites.</hi> Who, one would think, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted the Fact of <hi>Shechem;</hi> or, elſe it may ſeem ſtrange that they did not immediately cut off <hi>Jacob</hi> and his Family, who had taken ſuch a terrible Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge for it; but let them remove quietly to

                  <hi>Make there an Altar.</hi>] Perform the Vow which thou madeſt in that place, XXVIII. 20, 21, 22. Some wonder
<hi>Jacob</hi> made no more haſte to this place, after his return to his own Country, (for now he had been about <hi>nine</hi> Years in <hi>Canaan</hi>) and ſome of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Doctors fanſie God puniſhed him for deferring ſo long to go thither (where he promiſed to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him, if he proſpered his Journey and brought him back again in ſafety) by ſuffering his Daughter <hi>Dinah</hi> to be raviſhed. But it is more probable, that he met with obſtructions, which made it not ſafe for him, as yet, to go thither; or, that he waited till God, who had conducted him hitherto, ſhould direct him to take his Journey to that place. For, it is very probable, he enquired of him about his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>Then Jacob ſaid unto his houſholder,</hi> &amp;c.] Being to perform a ſolemn Sacrifice to God, he calls upon his Family to prepare themſelves for it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>And be clean.</hi>] Waſh your Bodies, as <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> truly interprets it: For this was the ancient Rite of cleanſing.

               <p>

Which was but a reaſonable Injunction, being to appear before the <hi>Divine Majeſty:</hi> In whoſe Preſence it was rudeneſs to be ſeen in ſordid Raiment: Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in thoſe, wherein they had newly defiled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by a bloody ſlaughter. Theſe <hi>two,</hi> I doubt not, were pious Cuſtoms, which their godly Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors had obſerved, from the beginning of offering Solemn Sacrifices. It being very unſeemly to appear before a great Man, in dirty Apparrel, or with a ſweaty Body. And I do not ſee, why we ſhould not look upon theſe, as an external Profeſſion, of the like Purity in their Minds and Hearts. All Nations retained theſe
<hi>Waſhings,</hi> and <hi>white Raiment,</hi> when they performed the Solemn Offices of Religion: Which were not derived from Idolaters, but from the pureſt Antiquity.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>And they gave unto Jacob all the ſtrange Gods.</hi>] Which, it ſeems by this Expreſſion, were nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the Ear-rings that were in their Ears.</hi>] In the Ears of the Idols; for there was no harm in the <hi>Ear-Rings</hi> they wore themſelves. So ſome interpret it; not conſidering, that beſides the
<hi>Ear-Rings</hi> which were Ornaments, there were others worn in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Amulets; or, for ſome other ſuperſtitious Uſes: Having the Effigies of ſome God or other; or, ſome Symbolical Notes, in which they fanſied there was ſome Power to preſerve them from ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Miſchiefs.
<hi>Maimonides</hi> in his Book of <hi>Idolatry, cap.</hi> 7. mentions ſuch Idololatrical Rings, as were ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly <pb n="475" facs="tcp:50230:245"/> unlawful to be uſed; and Veſſels marked with the Image of the <hi>Sun,</hi> the
<hi>Moon,</hi> or a <hi>Dragon:</hi> Which were Symbols of Divinity among the
<hi>Heathen;</hi> who made Marks alſo, in ſeveral parts of their Bodies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And Jacob hid them.</hi>] Buried them in the Earth; after he had firſt broke them in pieces (as ſome think) or melted them, as
<hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did, <hi>Exod.</hi> XXXII. 20. 2
<hi>Kings</hi> XVIII. 4. Which, if it be true, it is but a Tale which is told of the <hi>Samaritans;</hi> that they digged up theſe Idols and worſhipped them. See <hi>Hottinger Smegma Orient. p.</hi> 359.</p>

For he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to aboliſh the memory of theſe Idols; and therefore hid them, where he thought no Body would find them.</p>
               <p>It took up ſome time to do all this; and yet the People of the Land did not fall upon <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Family: The Providence of God watching over him, as it follows in the next <hi>Verſe.</hi>

               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>And they journeyed: And the terror of the LORD was upon the Cities round about them,</hi> &amp;c.] Here is the true reaſon why the Country did not, at leaſt, fall upon the Rear of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Family, when they marched away: Becauſe God made a panick Fear to fall upon them. Who, otherwiſe (one would gueſs by this) had an inclination to be revenged for the deſtruction of <hi>Shechem.</hi> For, though they could not juſtifie the Fact of <hi>Shechem;</hi> yet they might think <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Sons too cruel in the Puniſhment of it: For their own Father was of that Opinion.</p>

               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>Deborah, Rebekah's nurſe died.</hi>] She went to attend <hi>Rebekah,</hi> when ſhe was married to <hi>Iſaac:</hi> Which troubles the <hi>Jews</hi> to give an account how ſhe came here, into
<hi>Jacob</hi>'s Family. <hi>R. Solomon</hi> ſolves it thus; That
<hi>Rebekah</hi> having promiſed <hi>Jacob</hi> when he went away, to
<hi>ſend for him,</hi> (XXVII. 45.) ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed this Promiſe by
<hi>Deborah:</hi> Whom ſhe ſent to <hi>Padan-Aram</hi> to invite him home; and in her return ſhe died here. But it is more reaſonable to ſuppoſe that <hi>Jacob</hi> had been at his Father's Houſe, before this time: And
<hi>Rebekah</hi> being dead, (whether before or after, is uncertain)
<hi>Deborah</hi> was deſirous to live with his Wives, who were her Country-Women. And that her death is here mentioned (though we read nothing of
<hi>Rebekah</hi>'s) to give an account how this Oak came by the Name of
<hi>Allon-Bacuth,</hi> in after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times.</p>

                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder an Oak.</hi>] There were many about <hi>Bethel:</hi> Near to which there was a Wood, or Foreſt; out of which the Bears came, who devoured the Children that curſed <hi>Eliſha,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> II. 23. And under an Oak alſo, the old Prophet Found the Man of God ſitting, as he went from <hi>Bethel,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> XIII. 14.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>And God appeared unto Jacob again,</hi> &amp;c.] The
<hi>SCHECHINAH,</hi> or <hi>Divine Majeſty,</hi> who bad him go to
<hi>Bethel, verſe</hi> 1. appeared to him when he came there; in a moſt glorious manner: As he had done when he lodged there in his Journey to

                  <pb n="477" facs="tcp:50230:246"/>Ver. 10. <hi>Iſrael ſhall be thy Name.</hi>] This is a far more honourable Name than that of <hi>Jacob:</hi> And therefore by it thou ſhalt be commonly called. For the Name of <hi>Jacob</hi> was given him from the ſupplant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Brother, and getting the advantage of him: But this of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from his prevalence over the Angel of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he called his Name Iſrael.</hi>] He ſolemnly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that Name, which was given him before by his Angel, XXXII. 28.</p>
               <p>This ſeems to me to prove, That it was no more than an Angel, who wreſtled with <hi>Jacob,</hi> and told him his Name ſhould be changed. For, if it had been God himſelf, <hi>Jacob</hi> was as much ſatisfied then, as he could be now, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould be his Name. But I take it, God reſerved the declaration of it from his own Mouth, till this time: When he ratified what he had before ſpoken by his Angel.</p>
               <p>And thus I find (ſince I noted this) St. <hi>Hierom</hi> underſtood this Paſſage: Whoſe words are theſe. <hi>Dudum nequaquam ei nomen ab Angelo imponitur,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>This Name was not heretofore impoſed on him by the Angel; who only foretold that God would impoſe it on him: That therefore which was there promiſed ſhould be, we are here taught was fulfilled.</hi>

Then he himſelf bleſſed him; when he appeared to him, the firſt Night of his Journey, <hi>verſe</hi> 13. of that <hi>Chapter.</hi> And now again, when he was come back to the very ſame place; where he bleſſed him before. And he ſpeaks to him, by the Name of <hi>El-Shaddai,</hi> i. e.

<hi>Abraham,</hi> XVII. 1.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>And God went up from him.</hi>] It is evident by this, that a viſible Majeſty, or Glory appeared to him at this time: From whence the foregoing words were ſpoken to him: Which being done, it went up towards Heaven. In the <hi>Hebrew</hi> the words are, <hi>went up from upon him,</hi> or, <hi>over him;</hi> and the very ſame is ſaid of
<hi>Abraham,</hi> XVII. 22. as if the <hi>SCHECHI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAH</hi> appeared over his Head, in great Luſtre; whilſt he, perhaps, lay proſtrate upon the Ground.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Poured a drink-offering thereon.</hi>] To conſecrate it unto the Solemn Service of God. For which end he poured Oil upon it, as he had done upon the Stone, (XXVIII. 18.) which, in all likelihood, was a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal part of this Pillar. And having done all this, we are to ſuppoſe he not only offered Sacrifice; but paid the Tenth of all that God had given him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Vow, XXVIII. <hi>ult.</hi>

Which laſt words are an explication of the former, ſhowing with which of his Brethren he was. Not with the Sons of

                  <hi>He made him a Coat of many colours.</hi>] It is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly thought to ſignifie a Garment wrought with Threds of divers Colours; or, made up of <hi>pieces</hi> of Silk or Stuff, which had much variety in them; or, wrought, as ſome think, with Figures of Fruit, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things. See

<hi>Braunius</hi> (<hi>de Veſtib. Sacerd. Hebr.

               <p>
                  <hi>He told his Brethren.</hi>] This argues his great Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and Simplicity; that he had not yet Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding enough to conſider, how ill this Dream might be expounded; or, not Prudence enough to conceal, what might be ill interpreted by them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They hated him yet more.</hi>] The firſt ground of their Hatred was, their Father's great Love to him; and then, his informing their Father of their bad Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour: Which was ſtill increaſed by the fine Clothes his Father beſtowed on him; and now moſt of all, by this Dream; which they interpreted to ſignifie his Superiority over them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>Your Sheaves ſtood round about, and made obeyſance,</hi> &amp;c.] Or, gathered round about mine: Which was fulfilled, when they came for Corn into <hi>Egypt;</hi> of which theſe Sheaves, ſome think, were an apt repreſentation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="494" facs="tcp:50230:255"/>Ver. 8. <hi>Shalt thou indeed reign over us?</hi>] It ſeems they could readily interpret the meaning of a Dream: Which ſhows how common they were in thoſe Days.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For his Dreams, and for his Words.</hi>] This ſeems to import, that he had more Dreams of like nature; and was wont to talk of them: Which they thought ſavoured of Arrogance.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>He dreamt yet another Dream.</hi>] Which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the former; by repeating the ſame thing, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der different Figures. For as the former was taken from the Earth; ſo this from Heaven: And is more comprehenſive than the former; for it concerns his Father, as well as his Brethren.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Behold the Sun and the Moon,</hi> &amp;c.] They ſeemed to deſcend to him, or he to be carried up to them: Where they bowed, and lay at his Feet.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>His Father rebuked him.</hi>] Gave him a check; that <hi>Joſeph</hi> might not grow conceited of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and his Brethren might not be provoked to hate him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is this Dream, that thou haſt dreamed?</hi>] What an idle Dream is this?</p>
               <p>

               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>His Brethren envied him.</hi>] Though
<hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> ſeemed to ſlight what he ſaid; it incenſed his Brethren againſt him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But his Father obſerved the Saying.</hi>] He did not look upon it as a mere Fancy; but thought there might be ſomething in it. And therefore, though <pb n="495" facs="tcp:50230:255"/> he thought fit publickly to ſlight it, yet he took ſuch notice of it privately, that he preſerved it in Mind, and laid it up in his Heart; as the Scripture elſewhere ſpeaks. And it really was fulfilled, when he went down into <hi>Egypt;</hi> and, no doubt, ſhowed that Reſpect which was due to the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> of the Country: And ſo did his Mother <hi>Bilhah,</hi> and all his Brethren.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>His Brethren went to feed their Father's flock in Shechem.</hi>] As their Flocks increaſed, ſo they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged their Paſture: And they often removed to find freſh Paſture. Beſides, he had made a Purchace in this Place; where they fed his Flocks in his own Ground.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>Come, I will ſend thee unto them.</hi>] Make thy ſelf ready, that I may ſend thee to inquire of thy Brethrens Welfare. About which he was now the more ſolicitous; becauſe they were gone to a Place, where they had, ſome Years ago, given great provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the Country, by their barbarous Cruelty.</p>
               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>A certain Man found him.</hi>] Some take this to have been an <hi>Angel:</hi> Who took care of him, when he was at a loſs, which way to go. So <hi>Maimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides, P.</hi> II. <hi>More Nevochim, cap.</hi>

               <p>Ver. 23. <hi>His Coat of many colours.</hi>] By this it ſeems he was diſtinguiſhed from the reſt of his Brethren: Being not yet grown up to ſuch laborious Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as they followed abroad; and therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged to wear a richer ſort of Garment, with his Father at home. For, according to the common No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it was wrought, or embroidered with Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; which was accounted Noble, as well as Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, in ancient Times.

               <p>Ver. 34. <hi>Rent his Cloathes, and put ſack-cloth on his loins.</hi>] This was the higheſt degree of Mourning in thoſe Days.

<hi>Verſe</hi> ſeems to denote; that he reſolved not to ceaſe Mourning for him, as long as he lived.</p>
               <p>Ver. 35. <hi>All his Sons and Daughters.</hi>] He had but one Daughter: Therefore the meaning is, his Sons Wives, or their Daughters.</p>

                  <hi>I will go down into the Grave,</hi> &amp;c.] If <hi>Scheol</hi> here be expounded <hi>Grave,</hi> then the next words muſt be thus tranſlated, <hi>mourning for my Son;</hi> as <hi>R.

<hi>Chriſtophorus à Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtro</hi> upon the <hi>Second</hi> of

For an uncircumciſed Man was accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unclean, though he had renounced Idolatry: But a Woman born of uncircumciſed Parents, was not ſo accounted; if ſhe embraced the worſhip of the True God.

               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>Go in unto thy Brother's Wife,</hi> &amp;c.] This (ſay the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors) was an ancient Cuſtom, in force before the Law of <hi>Moſes:</hi> Which only enacted what had been formerly practiſed, (<hi>Maimon. P.</hi> III. <hi>cap.</hi> 49. <hi>More Nevoch.</hi>) that when a Man died with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Iſſue, his next Brother ſhould marry his Wife, <pb n="504" facs="tcp:50230:260"/>

               <p>
                  <hi>And raiſe up Seed unto thy Brother.</hi>] Preſerve thy Brother's Name and Family; by begetting a Child, which may be accounted his, and inherit his Eſtate. For ſo the Law was; that the Firſt-born of ſuch a match was not to be lookt upon as the Child of him that begat him; but as his Brother's, who was the Mother's firſt Husband. All the following Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, were to be his own.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>Onan knew that the Seed ſhould not be his.</hi>]

               <p>
                  <hi>Leſt he ſhould give Seed to his Brother.</hi>] Or,
<hi>leſt a Child ſhould be born in the name of his Brother,</hi> as the
<hi>Vulgar Latin</hi> interprets it very exactly, according to the Opinion of the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> obſerves, <hi>L.</hi> VII.
<hi>de Jure N. &amp; G. cap.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>The thing which he did diſpleaſed the LORD.</hi>] This made his Sin the more heinous, that he acted againſt the Divine Promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> concerning the multiplying of his Seed: Eſpecially againſt the Belief of the Promiſe of the
<hi>Meſſiah;</hi> that <hi>Seed</hi> for which all good Men longed.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>Remain a widow in thy Father's houſe,</hi> &amp;c.] It ſeems the Contract of Marriage at firſt, was ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in thoſe Days, that if the Husband died without Iſſue, the Woman muſt marry his next Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and, as long as any of his Brethren remained, they were bound to marry his Wife, and preſerve their Brother's Memory: Or, elſe ſolemnly renounce her, to their great infamy and diſgrace. This was ſo well known, that there is nothing in the Law, that enjoyns any new ſolemn Contract in ſuch a <pb n="505" facs="tcp:50230:260"/> Caſe: Becauſe the firſt Husband being dead, ſhe and the next Brother were Man and Wife, without any further Agreement, by Virtue of the Original Law: Until he renounced her. Yet by the Conſtitutions afterwards made by their Elders, it was ordained, that he ſhould eſpouſe and endow her ſolemnly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Witneſſes: As Mr.
<hi>Selden</hi> ſhows in his <hi>

               <p>But <hi>Judah</hi> thought <hi>Selah</hi> was too young to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form this Contract; and therefore deſired her to ſtay till he was grown up: And to abide in her own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Houſe, rather than in his; that
<hi>Selah</hi> might not think of Marriage too ſoon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For he ſaid, Leſt peradventure he die alſo.</hi>] This ſome make an Argument, that he never intended to give her his Son. But it is more agreeable to <hi>verſe</hi> 24, and 26. to think that according to the Cuſtom of thoſe Days, he could not refuſe it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he thought it was their youthful Folly, which made his two other Sons periſh: Which made him reſolve to keep this till he had more Diſcretion, and was better inſtructed in his Duty. Or, if we imagine their Sin was known to none but
<hi>Tamar;</hi> the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may be, that he thought their marrying too young was the cauſe of their death: And therefore he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to keep this only remaining Son, till he was of a riper Age.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>In proceſs of time.</hi>] In the <hi>Hebrew</hi> the words are, <hi>The Days were multiplied,</hi> i. e. after ſome Years.</p>

                  <hi>He went up to Timnath.</hi>] Some have made a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty about this Phraſe: For <hi>Sampſon</hi> is ſaid to have gone <hi>down to Timnath, Judg.</hi> XIV. 5. But they ſhould have conſidered (as <hi>Bochart</hi> obſerves, <hi>P.</hi> I. <hi>Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoic. L.</hi> III. <hi>cap.</hi> 4.) that theſe were two different Places, one called <hi>Timnah,</hi> the other <hi>Timnathah:</hi> This in the Tribe of
<hi>Judah;</hi> the other in the Tribe of <hi>Dan.</hi> To this they went up, becauſe it was in a mountainous Country: To the other they went down, becauſe it was in a Valley.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To his Sheep-ſhearers.</hi>] It was the Cuſtom at ſuch times to make a Feaſt, (as we do now) and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite their Kindred and Friends to it, (as he doth his Friend <hi>Hirah</hi>) which appears ſufficiently from the Story of <hi>Abſalom,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> XIII. 23. For in thoſe Countries, where they had vaſt Flocks,
<hi>Sheep-ſhearing</hi> was a kind of Harveſt: Which made that time to be obſerved with ſuch Joy, as there uſed to be in Harveſt. Whence
<hi>David</hi>'s Servants ſaid to <hi>Nabal,</hi> that they were come to him
<hi>on a good Day;</hi> for he was ſhearing Sheep, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> XXV. 8. Accordingly <hi>Judah</hi> having finiſhed the time of mourning for his Wife, went to recreate himſelf, with his Friends, at this Feſtival Seaſon.</p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>She put off her Widows Garments.</hi>] In which, it ſeems, ſuch Perſons continued, till they were mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the next Brother. But ſhe, at this time, laid them aſide, that he might not have the leaſt ſuſpicion ſhe was the Perſon whom he courted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Covered her with a Veil.</hi>] As all Women did, in the
<hi>Eaſtern</hi> Countries, when they went abroad: And there are Examples of it alſo in the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Parts of the World; as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> at large ſhows, in his <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xor Hebraica, L.</hi> III. <hi>cap.</hi> 17. Where he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces <pb n="507" facs="tcp:50230:261"/> ſeveral Paſſages out of the

               <p>
                  <hi>Wrapt her ſelf.</hi>] Muffled her Face with it, as we ſpeak, that ſhe might not be known.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſat in an open place.</hi>] Where two Ways met, as the
<hi>Hebrew</hi> words ſeem to import: Unleſs we take it for a proper Name, as it is in the Margin of our <hi>Bibles.</hi> Either way, it ſignifies, in a Publick Place, where every Body might ſee her. It is commonly noted, That there was ſo much Modeſty left, in thoſe ancient Days, that Harlots both went veiled, and alſo ſat without the Cities, (ſee <hi>Origen L.</hi> IV.
<hi>contra Celſum, p.</hi> 206.) But, however the latter part of this Obſervation be, the former part of it is not true. For, as <hi>Bochartus</hi> obſerves, (<hi>P.</hi> I. <hi>Hierozoic. Lib.</hi> II. <hi>cap.</hi> 46.)
<hi>Proprium fuit meretricum non</hi> velari, <hi>ſed</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velari; it was proper to Harlots not to be covered, but to go bare-faced: As appears from
<hi>Iſai.</hi> XLVII. 3. <hi>Nahum</hi> III. 5, &amp;c. All that can be anſwered to this is, That it might be otherwiſe, in very ancient Times. Which I do not take to be true: For all Women, as I obſerved before, were covered; and therefore Harlots were diſtinguiſhed only by their ſitting in the High-ways, not by their Veils.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For ſhe ſaw that Selah was grown, and ſhe was not given,</hi> &amp;c.] She reſolved, if ſhe could, to have a Child by one of this Family; and hoped, perhaps, that <hi>Selah</hi> might come along with his Father, and have the ſame Deſires his Father had: And in thoſe Days (as I noted before) there were no ſuch So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities required, as the <hi>Jews</hi> afterwards uſed (though the Law did not enjoyn it) to the making a Marriage with one's Brother's Wife. Which was to be contracted, they ſay, before two Witneſſes, and <pb n="508" facs="tcp:50230:262"/> by giving a piece of Money, or a Writing: But this was ordained only by their Elders, not by the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Law. See <hi>verſe</hi> 11. And therefore ſhe thought if ſhe could have caught
<hi>Selah</hi> by this Device, it would have been held Lawful: But this Plot failing her, ſhe ſo far tranſgreſſed, as to admit <hi>Judah</hi> himſelf to lie with her.</p>
               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>Becauſe ſhe covered her face.</hi>] This is not the reaſon why he took her for an Harlot; but why he did not know her to be his Daughter-in-law, (as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> obſerves in the place before-named, <hi>verſe</hi> 14.) becauſe he could not ſee her Face: And he thought her to be an Harlot, becauſe ſhe ſat <hi>in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio,</hi> in the High-way; where ſhe publickly expoſed her ſelf.</p>
               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>Let me come in unto thee.</hi>] There was an expreſs Law that there ſhould be no <hi>Kedeſhah</hi> (or <hi>Whore</hi>) among the Daughters of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> i. e. none who ſhould proſtitute her Body without Marriage, <hi>Deut.</hi> XXIII. 18. <hi>Levit.</hi> XIX. 29. But before the giving of the Law (ſaith <hi>Maimonides</hi>) if a Man found a ſingle Woman in a Publick Place, and they agreed on certain terms, to lie together without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing married, they were not puniſhed. See Mr. <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den L.</hi> V. <hi>de Jure N. &amp; G. cap.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What wilt thou give me?</hi>] That which made ſuch Facts not to be puniſhed, was (ſaith the ſame <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides</hi>) becauſe of the Contract which paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. This Reward which he gave the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot for the uſe of her Body, being like the Dowry a Man gave his Wife, when he put her away: Which being paid, it was thought he did her no wrong.

<hi>burning</hi> was the Puniſhment for Adultery in thoſe Days.

<hi>branding</hi> her in the Fore-head, to denote her to be an Whore. See Mr.

<hi>Selah</hi>'s Wife, though not ſolemnly married (as the <hi>Jews</hi> pretend it was neceſſary, after the Law was given) by Virtue of the firſt Contract with his eldeſt Brother.

               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>And Pharaoh ſaid unto Joſeph,</hi> &amp;c.] We may well ſuppoſe that <hi>Joſeph</hi> deſired to know the Dream: Which
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> repeats in this, and the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Verſes,</hi> ſomething more fully than it is ſet down before.</p>
               <p>Ver. 21. <hi>When they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them,</hi> &amp;c.] An Emblem <pb n="531" facs="tcp:50230:273"/> of a very grievous Famine: Which is repreſented, not only by the lean Kine devouring the Fat, (as much as to ſay, the barren Years conſuming all the growth of the Fertil) but by their remaining Lean, as if they had eaten nothing: Which repreſents what often happens in Famine, that Men eat greedily; but are not ſatisfied: Becauſe God <hi>breaks the Staff of Bread, Levit.</hi> XXVI. 26. <hi>i. e.</hi> takes away its nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Virtue; as
<hi>Bochart</hi> expounds it. <hi>Hierozoic. P.</hi> I. <hi>Lib.</hi> II.
<hi>cap.</hi> 41. But this ſeems to be a ſtraining of that Phraſe,
<hi>break the Staff of Bread:</hi> Which ſignifies no more, than want of Bread to ſupport Man's Life. And all that can be gathered from this part of the Dream, is; That there ſhould be ſuch exceeding great ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, that Men ſhould have but juſt enough to keep them alive.</p>
               <p>Ver. 25. <hi>The Dream of Pharaoh is one.</hi>] One and the ſame thing is repreſented, by two ſeveral Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God hath ſhewn Pharaoh what he is about to do.</hi>] God hath in theſe Dreams revealed to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> what he intends ſhortly to bring to paſs.</p>
               <p>Ver. 26. <hi>The ſeven good kine,</hi> &amp;c.] He repreſents in this, and in the following <hi>Verſe,</hi> how one thing is ſignified by two Dreams. Seven good Kine, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven good Ears, repreſenting ſeven Years of plenty; and ſeven lean Kine, and ſeven empty Ears, as many Years of ſcarcity.</p>
               <p>Ver. 28. <hi>This is the thing which I have ſpoken,</hi> &amp;c.] I have told the King in ſhort, what the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence is about to effect.</p>
               <p>Ver. 29. <hi>Behold, there come ſeven Years,</hi> &amp;c.] I will repeat it more at large. Take notice then, that in the next ſeven Years to this, there ſhall be very <pb n="532" facs="tcp:50230:274"/> great crops of Corn, every where, throughout the whole Country.</p>
               <p>Ver. 30. <hi>And there ſhall ariſe after them,</hi> &amp;c.] And immediately after they are ended, ſhall follow ſeven Years as barren as the former were fruitful; the Earth bringing forth little or no Corn. Which will make ſo great a Famine, that there ſhall be no memory of the foregoing plenty; for there ſhall be no Corn left, but all eaten up, throughout all the Land of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 31. <hi>And the plenty ſhall not be known,</hi> &amp;c.] I ſay, there ſhall be no mark remaining of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Plenty; by reaſon of the extream Scarcity, in the following Years, which will be very heavy.</p>
               <p>Ver. 32. <hi>And for that the Dream was doubled,</hi> &amp;c.] The repetition of the Dream ſignifies the certainty of what I ſay: God having ſo determined; who will ſhortly juſtifie the Truth of my Predictions. Both here, and in the foregoing Diſcourſe, <hi>verſe</hi>
25, 28. he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to look up unto God, as the Author of all theſe Events; and that not in an ordinary, but extraordinary manner. For ſuch Fertility, and ſuch Famine did not proceed from mere Natural Cauſes; but from an Over-ruling Providence. It is obſerved by <hi>Pliny, L.</hi> V.
<hi>Nat. Hiſt. cap.</hi> 9. that when <hi>Nile</hi> roſe only
<hi>twelve</hi> Cubits, a Famine followed: When <hi>thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen,</hi> great Scarcity: When <hi>fourteen,</hi> they had a good Year: When <hi>fifteen,</hi> a very good: And if it roſe <hi>ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen,</hi> it made <hi>delicias,</hi> luxuriant Plenty: And the greateſt increaſe they ever knew, was to
<hi>eighteen</hi> Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits. Now that this River ſhould overflow ſo large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for ſeven Years together, as to make vaſt Plenty; and then for the next ſeven Years not to overflow its Banks at all or very little, and ſo make a ſore <pb n="533" facs="tcp:50230:274"/> and long Famine; could be aſcribed to nothing but an extraordinary Hand of God; it being quite out of the courſe of Nature. And indeed the Dream ſeems to ſignifie ſomething beyond that; for it is unnatural for Oxen to devour one another.</p>
               <p>Ver. 33. <hi>Look out a Man diſcreet and wiſe.</hi>] One fit to manage ſo great an Affair. He that could fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell ſuch Events, was fit to adviſe what was to be done upon the foreſight of them: But, it's probable, he did not preſume to give ſuch Directions, till he was askt his Opinion.</p>
               <p>Ver. 34. <hi>Let Pharaoh do this.</hi>] When this is done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let him appoint Officers.</hi>] Let that Chief Ruler ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point Officers under him, in the ſeveral Provinces of the Kingdom: Such as the <hi>Romans</hi> called <hi>Praefectos Annonae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take up a fifth part.</hi>] Some have askt why not the
<hi>half,</hi> ſince there were to be as many Years of Famine, as of Plenty. To which ſuch anſwers as theſe have been given by Interpreters: That the greater and richer ſort were wont in time of Plenty to fill their Store-Houſes; as a Proviſion againſt a ſcarcer Year, which ſometimes hapned. And, <hi>Secondly,</hi> That in time of Famine, Men are wont to live more frugal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and not ſpend ſo much as they do in better times. And,
<hi>Thirdly,</hi> That even in thoſe Years of greateſt Famine, ſomething might be ſown; at leaſt near the Banks of <hi>Nile.</hi> But the plaineſt Anſwer is, That <hi>ten</hi> Parts being the Tribute due to Kings in many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and it is likely here, (as I obſerved upon XXVIII. <hi>ult.</hi>)
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> was adviſed to double this Charge, in the Years of extraordinary Plenty: When the <hi>fifth</hi> Part was not more than the
<hi>tenth</hi> in other <pb n="534" facs="tcp:50230:275"/> Years. Or, (which is rather to be ſuppoſed from a good King and a good Counſellor) to buy as much more as was his Tribute; Which he might do at an eaſie rate, when vaſt Plenty made Corn very cheap.</p>
               <p>Ver. 35. <hi>Gather all the Food of thoſe good Years that come.</hi>] The <hi>fifth</hi> Part of the growth of the next <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> Years.</p>

               <p>

               <p>Ver. 37. <hi>And the thing was good in the Eyes,</hi> &amp;c.] The King and all the Court were pleaſed with this Advice. But ſome may wonder that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Miniſters ſhould ſo readily believe a young Man; and a ſtranger; of a Nation whom they did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe withal, and lately accuſed of a great Crime. But they may be ſatisfied, by conſidering, that <hi>Joſeph</hi> had cleared himſelf in the Opinion of the Keeper of the Priſon; where he had been known already to have interpreted Dreams exactly according to the Events, in two notorious Caſes, which the chief But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler had reported, <hi>verſe</hi> 12, 13. And beſides, his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Figures which <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſaw in his
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:50230:275"/> Dream, was ſo natural, that it was apt to beget be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, if he had not been an Expounder of Dreams before. And above all it is to be conſidered, that God who ſent the Dreams, and made them ſtick in
<hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Thoughts, diſpoſed his Mind alſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Interpretation, with a deep Senſe of its Truth.</p>
               <p>Ver. 38. <hi>Pharaoh ſaid to his Servants.</hi>] The great Miniſters of the Kingdom, and Officers of the Court, who ſtood about him.</p>

<hi>Egypt.</hi> In which time, we may well think, he had learnt the Language of that Country, and gained much Experience; but never ſent to his Father: In which there is viſibly a ſpecial Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God; for his Father might have uſed means for his Deliverance, and then he had never come to this Greatneſs.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>And went throughout all the Land of Egypt.</hi>] He ſeems to have only taken a general view of the Country before, <hi>verſe</hi> 45. but now a more particular; to give Orders for the building of Store-Houſes, againſt the plenteous Years came.</p>
               <p>Ver. 47. <hi>Brought forth by handfuls.</hi>] Such large Ears, that a few of them would make a Sheaf: Which our Tranſlation ſeems here to mean by <hi>handfuls:</hi> For Sheaves are bound up with Mens Hands. And ſo it may be interpreted, it brought forth <hi>Sheaves,</hi> or <hi>Heaps:</hi> Or, more literally, <hi>handfuls upon one Stalk, i. e.</hi> vaſt abundance. Some conceive the Corn was laid up in Sheaves, heaped up very high; and not thraſh'd out: For ſo it would keep the longer.</p>
               <p>Ver. 48. <hi>And he gathered up all the Food.</hi>] The fifth Part, as he had propoſed, <hi>verſe</hi> 34. <hi>i. e.</hi> he bought it;

               <p>

               <p>Ver. 49. <hi>Gathered Corn as the Sand of the Sea.</hi>] The following words explain this Hyperbolical Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. And the reaſon of his heaping up ſo much was, that there might be ſufficient to ſupply the Neceſſities of other Countries, as well as of <hi>Egypt.</hi>

               <p>Ver. 1. <hi>AND when Jacob ſaw that there was Corn in Egypt,</hi> &amp;c.] He ſaw, perhaps, ſome paſs by laden with Corn, which they had bought there. Or, one Senſe (as is frequent in Scripture) is put for another: <hi>Seeing</hi> for <hi>Hearing;</hi> as it is expreſſed,
<hi>verſe</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Why do ye look one upon another?</hi>] As idle People uſe to do, while none of them will ſtir to ſeek Relief. Or, rather, as Men that know not what courſe to take, expecting who would begin to adviſe for their Preſervation.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>That we may live, and not die.</hi>] He excites them to make no further delay, by the great Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity wherein they were; no leſs than danger of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing.</p>
               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>Leſt miſchief befal him.</hi>] He being, as yet, but young, and not uſed to travel, <hi>Jacob</hi> was afraid the Journey might be hazardous to him. Beſides, he could not but deſire to have ſome of their Company; though this was not his principal Reaſon.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>Came to buy Corn among thoſe that came.</hi>] Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple came from all Parts thereabout, upon the ſame Buſineſs: And
<hi>Jacob</hi>'s Sons among others; whom, perhaps, they met withal upon the Road.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>And Joſeph was the Governor,</hi> &amp;c.] The
<hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> word <hi>Schallit</hi> ſignifies ſometimes, one that hath abſolute Power: And ſeems to be uſed here to ſet forth the high Authority which <hi>Joſeph</hi> exerciſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>

                  <hi>He it was that ſold to all the People of the Land.</hi>] Appointed at what Rates Corn ſhould be ſold, in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Part of the Country. For it is not to be ſuppoſed that he in Perſon, could treat with every man that came to buy: But he, by his Deputies, who obſerved his Orders.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And Joſeph's Brethren came.</hi>] It ſhould ſeem by this, that all Foreigners, were ordered to come to him; in the Royal City, where he reſided: Or, at leaſt, their Names were brought to him, that he might ſpeak with ſuch as he thought fit: And thereby get the better Intelligence of the State of their ſeveral Countries; and be ſure to ſee his Brethren, who, he knew, would be conſtrained to come thither.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They bowed themſelves before him,</hi> &amp;c.] Unwitting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fulfilled his Dream. This ſeems to have been done after the manner of their own and other <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern</hi> Countries; not of
<hi>Egypt,</hi> where they only bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Knee, XLI. 40.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>Spake roughly to them.</hi>] Gave them hard words, as we ſpeak. Or, ſpake in a harſh Tone to them, and with a ſtern Countenance.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>And they knew not him.</hi>] They had not ſeen him in <hi>twenty</hi> Years: In which time a Youth alters far more than grown Men do; ſo that, though he knew them, they might not know him. Who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared alſo in ſuch Pomp and State, that it made them not think of him: And he ſpake alſo to them by an Interpreter, <hi>verſe</hi> 23: Which repreſented him as a Stranger to them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>Ye are Spies.</hi>] He did not think they were ſuch Perſons, but ſaid this to provoke them, to give an account of themſelves, and of his Father. Nor is there any reaſon to look upon this as a Lye. For <pb n="545" facs="tcp:50230:280"/> they are not words of Affirmation, but of Probati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Trial: Such as Judges uſe, when they exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine ſuſpected Perſons, or inquire into a Crime, of which Men are accuſed. And therefore have the force of an Interrogation; <hi>Are ye not Spies?</hi> Or, I muſt take you for Spies, till you prove the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To ſee the nakedneſs of the Land are ye come.</hi>] The weak Places of the Country; which are leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſible. Or, as others will have it, <hi>the Secrets of the Land:</hi> For it is the ſame word that is uſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, the privy Parts.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>We are all one Man's Sons.</hi>] There needed no more than this to take off his ſuſpicion. For no Man would have ſent his Sons, but rather his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, if they had come upon an ill Deſign: Or, at leaſt, not all his Sons; or, not all of them together in a Company: But diſperſed them rather about the Country. Nor was it probable, that one Man could have a Deſign upon <hi>Egypt;</hi> but all the great Men of
<hi>Canaan</hi> muſt have joyned in it: And then they would have ſent Men of different Families, not all of one alone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We are true Men.</hi>] This was a good Argument, that they ſaid true, when they told him (<hi>verſe</hi> 10.) they had no other buſineſs in <hi>Egypt</hi> but to buy Corn.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>And he ſaid unto them, Nay,</hi> &amp;c.] Unleſs you have better Arguments than this, I muſt take you for Spies. He ſlights their Argument, as great Men ſometimes do, when they know not preſently how to anſwer it. He had a mind alſo to have them give a further account of their Family, that he might be informed what was become of his Brother <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="546" facs="tcp:50230:281"/>Ver. 13. <hi>Thy Servants are twelve Brethren,</hi> &amp;c.] They inforce their former Argument, by relating their Condition more fully and diſtinctly. But ſtill it amounts to no more than this; That it was not likely a Parent would venture all his Children, in ſuch a Deſign, as they were ſuſpected to come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The youngeſt is this Day with our Father.</hi>] This was the thing he deſired to know.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And one is not.</hi>] Is dead. So they thought, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had heard nothing of him, in <hi>twenty</hi> Years ſpace.</p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>This is that I ſpake unto you,</hi> &amp;c.] This confirms what I ſaid, and gives me juſt ground for ſuſpicion, that you are Spies: Becauſe you pretend to have another Brother, which is not likely; for why ſhould not your Father ſend all, as well as ſo many? This was but a Cavil; but ſerved to compaſs his End: Which was to ſee his Brother.</p>
               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>Hereby ſhall ye be proved.</hi>] By this very thing ſhall you be tried; whether you be honeſt Men, or no.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>In that we ſaw the anguiſh of his Soul,</hi> &amp;c.] We would have no pity, when he beſought us with Tears; and now nothing that we can ſay, will move this Man. They obſerve their Guilt in their Puniſhment. For, as they had thrown <hi>Joſeph</hi> into a Pit, ſo they
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:50230:282"/> had been thrown into a Priſon themſelves: And as nothing he could ſay, would incline them to ſpare him, ſo now they found
<hi>Joſeph</hi> inexorable to them.</p>
               <p>This Anguiſh of his Soul, and his Entreaties are not mentioned before, (<hi>Chap.</hi> XXXVII.) but could not but be ſuppoſed, if they had not been mentioned here.</p>
               <p>Ver. 22. <hi>And Reuben anſwered them,</hi> &amp;c.] You ſhould have hearkned unto me, and then you had not come into this Diſtreſs.</p>

                  <hi>Behold alſo, his Blood is required.</hi>] You killed him, and now you muſt pay for it with the loſs of your Lives. For he thought him to be dead.</p>
               <p>Ver. 23. <hi>Spake to them by an Interpreter.</hi>] This ſhows the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Tongue and the <hi>Hebrew</hi> were different; though in ſome words they might agree.</p>
               <p>Ver. 24. <hi>And he turned himſelf about from them.</hi>] And went into ſome other Room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And wept.</hi>] Natural Affection was too ſtrong for the Perſon he put on: And would not ſuffer him to counterfeit any longer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Returned to them, and communed with them.</hi>] When he had vented his Paſſion, and compoſed himſelf to his former Temper, he repeated to them what he had told them before: But added withal, That if they brought <hi>Benjamin</hi> with them, they might Traffick in the Land,
<hi>verſe</hi> 34.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And took from them Simeon.</hi>] Who, the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſay, was the Perſon that put <hi>Joſeph</hi> into the Pit: And therefore was now ſerved in his kind. This, I think, may be fairly conjectured, That
<hi>Reuben</hi> being reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ſave him, and <hi>Judah</hi> alſo inclined to favour him; if <hi>Simeon</hi> had joyned with them, their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity might have prevailed to deliver him.</p>

               <p>Ver. 25. <hi>To give them Proviſion for the way.</hi>] That they might carry what they bought intire, for the uſe of their Family.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And thus he did unto them.</hi>] Thus the Perſon, to whom
<hi>Joſeph</hi> gave that Command, did unto them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 26. <hi>And they laded their Aſſes with Corn,</hi> &amp;c.] It is not ſaid how many Aſſes they laded; but one would gueſs by what follows, only each Man one. For they went only to fetch a preſent Supply: Not thinking of providing againſt a long Famine.</p>
               <p>Ver. 27. <hi>And as one of them opened his Sack,</hi> &amp;c.] Wherein was their Proviſion for the Way, <hi>verſe</hi> 25.</p>
               <p>Ver. 28. <hi>He ſaid unto his Brethren,</hi> &amp;c.] Who all preſently opened their Sacks and found their Money there. For ſo the Story is told by <hi>Judah</hi> at their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Egypt,</hi> XLIII. 21: And both by that place and this, it appears this hapned to them when they came unto their Inn, to reſt themſelves, in their firſt Day's Journey.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And their Heart failed them,</hi> &amp;c.] Their Guilt made them afraid; otherwiſe they would have rejoyced. But all things terrifie an evil Conſcience: Which made them think ſome Deſign was laid to undo them all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is this that God hath done unto us?</hi>] Now God was in all their Thoughts, as the Chief Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of all things; whoſoever was the Inſtrument.</p>
               <p>Ver. 30. <hi>The Man who is the Lord of the Land.</hi>] By this it appears <hi>Joſeph</hi> was little leſs than a King, <hi>i. e.</hi> in his Authority and Sway, which he bare in that Country.</p>

               <p>Ver. 34. <hi>And ye ſhall traffick in the Land.</hi>] Buy Corn, or any thing elſe the Country affords; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any lett or impediment.</p>
               <p>Ver. 35. <hi>When both they and their Father ſaw the bundles of Money,</hi> &amp;c.] They had ſeen the ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: Therefore this is ſet down to expreſs the Fear which <hi>Jacob</hi> himſelf was in, at the ſight of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; though we may well ſuppoſe their Fear was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, when they perceived him to have the ſame Apprehenſions which they had, of ſome Deſign that might be laid againſt their Lives, when they returned to <hi>Egypt,</hi> though they brought their younger Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 36. <hi>Simeon is not.</hi>] He lookt upon him as dead; being in the Power of ſo rough a Man, as they deſcribed the Lord of the Land to be: Eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if he did not ſend <hi>Benjamin</hi> thither, as, for the preſent, he was reſolved not to do.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Ver. 37. <hi>Slay my two Sons if I bring him not to thee.</hi>] Nothing could be more fooliſhly ſaid; for what Good would it do
<hi>Jacob</hi> (nay, what an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of his Affliction would it have been) to loſe two Grand-Children, after he had loſt another Son? But it was ſpoken out of a paſſionate Deſire to redeem <hi>Simeon,</hi> and to make more Proviſion for their Family: Being confident that <hi>Joſeph</hi> (who <pb n="552" facs="tcp:50230:284"/> profeſſed to fear God, <hi>verſe</hi> 18.) would be as good as his Word.</p>

For we know ſome of the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves afterwards ſcrupled to eat with thoſe who had unwaſhen Hands; and ſeveral Nations have avoided ſuch Familiarity with others, merely on the account of their different Cuſtoms.

               <p>Ver. 34. <hi>And he took and ſent meſſes,</hi> &amp;c.] Ordered thoſe that waited to take and carry Meſſes from his own Table, unto theirs. For ſuch was the ancient Cuſtom, for great Men to honour ſuch as were in their Favour, by ſending Diſhes to them, which were firſt ſerved up to themſelves: From whence they were called MISSA,
<hi>Meſſes,</hi> things ſent. The ancient way of eating alſo is to be obſerved, which was not like ours: As appears by <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his
<hi>Sympoſ.

               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>And put my Cup,</hi> &amp;c.] The <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biah</hi> ſignifies an emboſſed Cup, (as we now ſpeak) or a

               <p>
                  <hi>And whereby indeed he divineth?</hi>] The <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <hi>Nachaſh,</hi> which we tranſlate <hi>Divine,</hi> it is very likely was anciently of an indifferent ſignification. And therefore
<hi>Grotius</hi> thinks that <hi>Joſeph</hi> meant by this Speech, that he uſed this Cup in his <hi>Drink-Offerings;</hi> when he ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed, to prepare himſelf to receive Divine Preſages. But, I think, we had better ſay, there was a kind of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vination by Cups (though we know not what it was) as we are certain there was by many other things among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> (who borrowed much of their Religion from the <hi>Egyptians</hi>) than give this or other ſuch like Interpretation of theſe words: Particularly, their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the ſparkling of the Wine in their Libations. For it ſeems plain to me, that <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſpeaks of the Cup he uſed at his own Table: And it is not probable that he uſed the ſame in Sacrifices to God. Such Veſſels as were uſed in Divine Service, were not uſed in their own: Being held Sacred; and therefore ſeparated from common uſe; and kept ſo ſafe, no doubt, that it was not eaſie to ſteal them. He ſpeaks therefore of ſome Divination that was uſed at their Meals: Which doth not ſignifie that <hi>Joſeph</hi> practiſed it, nor doth his Steward
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:50230:289"/> ſay he did; but only asks ſuch a Queſtion, as might make them think he did. For, being a known Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Dreams; People, perhaps, thought he was skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led alſo in the Arts of Divination. But the words are ſtill capable of a more ſimple Interpretation. For
<hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſh</hi> ſometimes ſignifies no more, than to <hi>make an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment:</hi> As in the words of <hi>Laban,</hi> XXX. 27. And ſo the meaning may be, (as <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> expounds this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage) might you not have conſidered, that <hi>my Maſter made a trial,</hi> (ſo we interpret in the Margin) by laying this in your way, <hi>whether you were honeſt Men, or Filch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> as you are now proved to be? Or, as others will have it, <hi>This is the Cup wherein he drinks himſelf, and finds out what is in other Men,</hi> when they drink liberally with him at his Table; as you lately did. But the former is more likely to be the meaning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ye have done evil, in ſo doing.</hi>] You have rendred your ſelves very criminal by this Fact. Or, you have done very fooliſhly in ſtealing a thing of this Nature: Which, being in continual uſe, would be ſoon miſſed.</p>

<hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> tells us, (<hi>L.</hi> I. §. 2. <hi>p.</hi> 47.
<hi>Edit. Steph.</hi>) where he ſaith the Country being divided into
<hi>three</hi> Parts, the <hi>Prieſts</hi> had one, their <hi>King</hi> a ſecond, and the <hi>Soldiers</hi> a third: And there were <hi>three</hi> other Ranks of Men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe, <hi>viz. Shepherds, Husbandmen,</hi> and
<hi>Artificers.</hi> The <hi>Husbandmen,</hi> he ſaith, ſerved their King, and Prieſts, and Military Men in tilling their Ground, for ſmall Wages, and ſpent all their time in it. And the like ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, he ſaith, is given of their <hi>Shepherds,</hi> who, from their Fore-fathers, followed that way of living. Which makes it plain they could not abominate thoſe who were ſo ſerviceable to them; though they might contemn them as mean People, who never roſe to any higher Employment. But we need not go to him for the proof of this: It being apparent from this very Book, that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> had Sheep, and Oxen, as well as Horſes and Aſſes, which they ſold to
<hi>Joſeph</hi> for Corn in the time of Famine, (XLVII. 17.) and that
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſpake to <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> to make ſuch of his Brethren as were Men of Skill, Rulers over his Flocks, (XLVII. 6.) which is a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration they bred Cattle as well as other Nations. And therefore if we will underſtand this to be true of all Shepherds, without exception, then by
<hi>Egyptians</hi> (to whom Shepherds are ſaid to be an abomination) we muſt not underſtand all the People of the Country of <hi>Egypt,</hi> (Shepherds being a part of them) but only the <hi>Courtiers</hi> and great Men, as in XLV. 2. the <hi>Egyptians</hi> are ſaid to hear <hi>Joſeph</hi> weep,
<hi>i. e.</hi> thoſe that belong'd to the Court: Who, it is likely, deſpiſed Shepherds, (as <hi>Rupertus Tuitienſis</hi> long ago expounded this Paſſage) but that is far ſhort of abominating them, which the
<hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> 
                  <pb n="579" facs="tcp:50230:297"/> word imports. But after all this, I do not ſee how they could be contemptible, if it be true which the ſame
<hi>Diodorus</hi> ſaith, <hi>p.</hi> 58. That when they buried a Corps, and made the Funeral Encomium, they never mentioned the Parentage of the deceaſed, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>, <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king account that all the People of</hi> Egypt, <hi>were alike well-born.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We muſt confine therefore this Aſſertion to
<hi>Foreign</hi> Shepherds; and it is not eaſie to give the reaſon why they were an abomination to the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> who were Shepherds themſelves.
<hi>Onkelos</hi> and <hi>Jonathan,</hi> with a great many others, think that they would not converſe (for that is meant by abomination) with the
<hi>Hebrew</hi> Shepherds, becauſe they had no greater regard to thoſe Creatures which the <hi>Egyptians</hi> worſhipped, than to breed them up to be eaten. But there is no good proof that they worſhipped Sheep or Oxen in thoſe Days; and, on the contrary, it appears both out of <hi>Herodotus,</hi> and <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus Siculus,</hi> that they ſacrificed ſuch Creatures, in their Days, and alſo eat of the Sacrifices, when they had done. See
<hi>Herodot.</hi> in <hi>Euterpe, Cap.</hi> 40, 41. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the reaſon given by others for this Abhorrence is not ſolid; that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> did eat no Fleſh, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ſcore could not endure thoſe that did. This is the Account which <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> gives of this Matter; who fanſies they were like the <hi>Indians,</hi> in his time, who abominated Shepherds, becauſe they drunk Milk; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their Manners, who taſted nothing that came from any living Creature. But, as it cannot be proved that this Superſtition was ſo old as <hi>Jacob</hi>'s time; ſo the contrary is evident from this very Book, XLIII. 16. where <hi>Joſeph</hi> bids his Steward go home and <hi>ſlay and make ready</hi> a Dinner for his Brethren: Whom he did not <pb n="580" facs="tcp:50230:298"/> intend to entertain after the
<hi>Hebrew</hi> but after the <hi>Egy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptian</hi> Faſhion; that he might not be known by them. And ſo <hi>Herodotus</hi> informs us, that in his days, though they abſtained from ſome Animals, yet they eat of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: Both Fiſh and Birds. <hi>Euterpe, cap.</hi> 78.

               <p>
                  <hi>Joſ. Scaliger</hi> therefore thinks this ſort of Men were abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, becauſe they had often raiſed Rebellion in
<hi>Egypt,</hi> and made a King of their own; who erected that which is called the <hi>Paſtoral Kingdom.</hi> This is embraced by many great Men, who have only the Authority of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netho</hi> for it; who ſays theſe were
<hi>Phoenician</hi> Shepherds (as <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells us, <hi>Lib.</hi> I. <hi>contra Appion.</hi>) who reigned in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and burnt their Cities, threw down their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; in ſhort, omitted no ſort of Cruelties. Upon this account the famous <hi>Bochartus</hi> (<hi>Lib.</hi> IV. <hi>Canaan, cap.</hi> 4.) thinks it poſſible the <hi>Egyptians</hi> hated Shepherds, who had done ſo much Miſchief: And, I may add, the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds <hi>Joſeph</hi> might think would be more abominated, becauſe they came out of that very Country, from whence thoſe <hi>Phoenician</hi> Rovers made their Invaſion. But as it doth not appear that they who did the fore-named Miſchief, were all Foreigners: So the time which is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for this <hi>Paſtoral Kingdom,</hi> doth not agree with the Scripture-Story. For it is ſaid to have been in the <hi>One thouſand one hundred and twelfth</hi> Year before the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> going out of
<hi>Egypt;</hi> in the XVth <hi>Dynaſty,</hi> as they call it: That is, about
<hi>Two and forty</hi> Years after the Flood, when <hi>Mizraim</hi> the Father of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> was ſcarce born, or was very young.</p>
               <p>Our great Primate <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſſer</hi> endeavours to avoid this ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity, by placing this Invaſion (which he thinks was
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:50230:298"/> out of <hi>Arabia</hi>) <hi>three hundred</hi> Years after the Flood: When they took <hi>Memphis;</hi> over-run all the lower
<hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt;</hi> and their firſt King, there reigned <hi>nineteen</hi> Years. But I have this to except; that <hi>Abraham</hi> coming a good while after this into <hi>Egypt,</hi> was well entertained there; though he was as much a Shepherd as his Grand-Child <hi>Jacob.</hi> See <hi>Gen.</hi> XII.</p>
               <p>From whence I conclude, That if this Story of <hi>Mane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho</hi> be true, it hapned after the time of <hi>Abraham;</hi> and ſo was freſh in their memory. Such a third Rebellion of the Shepherds the ſame
<hi>Manetho</hi> mentions, within leſs than <hi>two hundred</hi> Years before the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s departure out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> But this ſeems to be a Story framed, from that departure of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> themſelves (who were Shepherds) out of <hi>Egypt</hi> under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of
<hi>Moſes.</hi> And ſo <hi>Joſephus,</hi> and ſeveral of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Chriſtians (<hi>Tatianus, Juſtin Martyr,</hi> and <hi>Clem. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexand.</hi>) underſtood it. See <hi>

               <p>All this conſidered <hi>Gaulmin</hi> (in his Notes upon the Book called the <hi>Life of Moſes, p.</hi> 267, &amp;c.) hath more probably conjectured, That this averſation to Shepherds aroſe from their being generally addicted, in thoſe Parts, to Robbery: Which way of life made them abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable.

<hi>Bochartus</hi> himſelf inclined before he died, and confirms it (in his
<hi>Hierozoic. L.</hi> II. <hi>c.</hi> 44. <hi>P.</hi> I.) by many Proofs, that Shepherds anciently were <hi>furax hominum genus,</hi> a thieviſh ſort of People; which made them odious. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which I ſee no exception but this; that <hi>Aulus Gellius</hi> tells us (<hi>Lib.</hi> XI. <hi>cap.</hi> 18.) out of an ancient Lawyer, That the old <hi>Egyptians</hi> held all manner of
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:50230:299"/> Thefts to be lawful, and did not puniſh them. And
<hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> mentions this Law among them, That they who would live by Robbery, were to enter their Names, and bring what they ſtole, immediately to the Prieſt. Who mulct the Man that was robbed a fourth part; and gave it to the Thief. By which means all Thefts were diſcovered, and Men were made more careful, to look well after their Goods. But one cannot believe this Law was of ſuch Antiquity, as the Times of <hi>Joſeph:</hi> Or, if it was, thoſe <hi>Out-Laws</hi> (as I may call them) who robb'd upon the Borders, were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it: Nor had their Neighbours, who were no leſs addicted to Theft, the benefit of it. Particularly thoſe in
<hi>Paleſtine,</hi> from whence <hi>Jacob</hi> came; one would gueſs by what we read 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> VII. 21, 22. were then much addicted to Robbery. For, before this Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ended, we are told there the Men of <hi>Gath</hi> ſlew ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the Sons of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> (who himſelf was then alive) <hi>for they came down to take their Cattle,</hi> ſaith that Holy Writer; that is, to get what Plunder they could in <hi>Goſhen:</hi> Where the

<hi>black <pb n="583" facs="tcp:50230:299"/> People:</hi> Which was the Complexion of the

<hi>Moſes</hi> ſays they did Shepherds, upon ſome or other of the accounts before-mentioned.</p>
               <p>It looks like a piece of great Generoſity in
<hi>Joſeph,</hi> not to conceal from <hi>Pharaoh</hi> the Quality of his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: Though ſuch kind of Men were under a very ill Character.

               <p>
                  <hi>According to their Families.</hi>] According as their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were more, or fewer, ſo he proportioned their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>There was no Bread in all the Land.</hi>] This was the <hi>third</hi> Year of the Famine, (XLV. 6.) in which all the Corn, which Men had ſtored up in their ſeveral Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, was wholly ſpent.</p>

               <p>Ver. 19. <hi>Wherefore ſhould we die, we and our Land?</hi>] The Land is ſaid to die, (as <hi>Bochart</hi> obſerves, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his <hi>Hierozoicon</hi>) <hi>cùm inculta jacet &amp; deſolata,</hi> when it lies untill'd and deſolate: As he ſhows by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples out of ſome Poets.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We, and our Land will be Servants unto Pharaoh.</hi>] We, that were Free, will become the King's Bond-men: And our Land, which was our own, we will hold of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And give us Seed,</hi> &amp;c.] This ſhows it was now the laſt Year of the Famine: They deſiring Corn not mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for Food, but alſo to Sow; in hopes to have a Crop the next Year. For <hi>Joſeph</hi> had told them, there ſhould be but <hi>ſeven</hi> Years of Famine: And it is likely <hi>Nilus</hi> had now begun to overflow the Country, as formerly; which confirmed his word.</p>
               <p>Ver. 20. <hi>And Joſeph bought all the Land of Egypt for Pharaoh.</hi>] So the whole Country became the King's Demeſne; in which no Man had any Propriety but himſelf.</p>
               <p>Ver. 21. <hi>As for the People, he removed them to Cities.</hi>] Remote from thoſe wherein they had formerly dwelt. Under the word
<hi>Cities,</hi> is comprehended all the Villages about them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>From one end of the borders of Egypt,</hi> &amp;c.] Tranſplanted them into far diſtant Parts of the Country; from whence he brought others, in like manner, into their places: That they might in time, forget the Dominion they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly had in the Lands they had ſold; and that there might be no Combination afterward to regain them: The old Owners being ſeparated far one from another.</p>

                  <pb n="588" facs="tcp:50230:302"/>Ver. 22. <hi>Only the Land of the Prieſts bought he not.</hi>] This is commonly noted, as a great piece of Religion in <hi>Joſeph,</hi> that he took not away the Land of thoſe who were God's Miniſters: Though engaged, it's thought, in Superſtitious, if not Idolatrous Services, (for that the word <hi>Cohanim</hi> here ſignifies
<hi>Prieſts,</hi> not <hi>Princes,</hi> as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it doth, the ancient Verſions generally agree.) But it is plain they were in no neceſſity to ſell their Lands, having their Diet continually from the King: Which is given as the reaſon (in the following part of this <hi>Verſe</hi>) why he did not buy them. This therefore is rather to be obſerved, that the Prieſts had anciently ſome Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Lands allotted to them for the ſupport of their Dignity. For both <hi>Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Diodorus</hi> tell us, they had a Publick Maintenance, as <hi>Voſſius</hi> obſerves, <hi>Lib.</hi> I.

2294. <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, in part, imitated this Conſtitution, in that Law of his, which made even all the Profeſſors of Learning free from all Publick Charges of any ſort, beſides the Salary he allowed them; that they might the more chearfully follow their ſeveral Studies.</p>
               <p>Ver. 23. <hi>Behold, I have bought you this day, and your Land,</hi> &amp;c.] The Bargain could not be denied; but he would not be ſo rigid as to tye them ſtrictly to it. For <pb n="589" facs="tcp:50230:302"/> in the next
<hi>Verſe,</hi> he requires only a <hi>fifth</hi> part of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of their Ground for the King; and tells them, the reſt ſhould be their own. An act of great Humanity and Equity: Wherein he ſhow'd himſelf, both a good Man, and a wiſe States-Man; in taking away all matter of complaint from the People. For a <hi>tenth</hi> part of the increaſe was due, in all likelihood, to the King before, (XXVIII. 22.) which he now only doubles: When he might have taken all; or, given them but one or two parts, and kept all the reſt for the King.</p>
               <p>Ver. 25. <hi>Thou haſt ſaved our lives,</hi> &amp;c.] We owe our ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Lives to thee; and therefore let us but have thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and we ſhall willingly be <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Servants. This is an high Expreſſion of their Thankfulneſs, for ſuch good Terms as he offered them; which they readily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted: With profeſſions of their Obligation to be <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>'s Bond-men.</p>
               <p>Ver. 26. <hi>Joſeph made it a Law.</hi>] By his Advice this Law was enacted; whereby the Power of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Kings was mightily increaſed; for we read not of the like Conſtitution in any other Nation.
<hi>Thucydides</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed relates that the People of <hi>Attica</hi> paid to
<hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> the <hi>twentieth</hi> part of their Corn; and
<hi>Appianus Alexandr.</hi> ſays, the old <hi>Romans</hi> paid the
<hi>tenth</hi> of their Corn, and the <hi>fifth</hi> of their Fruit: But it was the peculiar Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Kings, to have the
<hi>fifth</hi> of all the increaſe of the Field: Which <hi>Joſeph</hi> procured them by his admirable Management.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>And they had poſſeſſions therein.</hi>] They could have no Land of their own, (for all the Country was become <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s) but the meaning is, they farmed (as we ſpeak) Land of the King; to whom they became Tenants.</p>

This plainly appears at their going from thence, <hi>Exod.</hi> XII. 22, 23. where God Commands them to ſprinkle their Door-Poſts with the Blood of the Paſchal Lamb, to ſecure them from the deſtruction, which was coming upon their Neighbours, who wanted this Mark of Safety.</p>

               <p>Ver. 30. <hi>I will lie with my Fathers,</hi> &amp;c.] So all Men naturally deſire to do: But he had a peculiar reaſon for it. Which was his belief that the Country where their Bodies lay, was his in Reverſion; and that God, in due time, would put his Children into poſſeſſion of it. For which time they could not but the more earneſtly long, becauſe the Bodies of their Anceſtors were there buried. See L. 5. which explains the reaſon why <hi>Jacob</hi> exacts an Oath of <hi>Joſeph;</hi> not becauſe he doubted he might not otherwiſe fulfil his Deſire; but that
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> might <pb n="591" facs="tcp:50230:303"/> be willing to let him carry his Body thither, when he found he lay under ſo Sacred an Obligation to do it.</p>
               <p>Ver. 31. <hi>And Iſrael bowed himſelf upon the Bed's head.</hi>] Raiſed up his Head from his Pillow, and bowed: Either to
<hi>Joſeph,</hi> in Thankfulneſs for his Promiſe; or, to God, for the Aſſurance he had received, that he ſhould be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with his Pious Fore-fathers: Or, elſe this <hi>bowing</hi> was the uſual Ceremony, wherewith an Oath was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. The <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſt thinks the
<hi>Divine Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> now appeared; which <hi>Jacob</hi> devoutly worſhipped. But, if the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> had not underſtood his <hi>bowing</hi> to be an act of Worſhip, the Interpretation of ſome modern Writers might, perhaps, have been thought reaſonable: Who tranſlate theſe words thus, <hi>He laid himſelf down upon his Pillow:</hi> As weak Men are wont to do; after they have ſat up a while, to diſpatch ſome buſineſs. For the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <hi>Schacah,</hi> which ſignifies
<hi>to bow the Body;</hi> ſignifies alſo to <hi>fall down</hi> upon the Earth: And therefore might be here tranſlated <hi>lie down.</hi> But the Apoſtle, as I ſaid, hath over-ruled all ſuch Conceits, if we ſuppoſe him to tranſlate this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, <hi>Hebr.</hi> XI. 21. Which to me indeed doth not ſeem evident. For the Apoſtle is there ſpeaking of another thing; not of what <hi>Jacob</hi> did now, when <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſware to him; but of what he did <hi>after theſe things,</hi> (XLVIII. 1.) when he bleſſed <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Sons. Then the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>he worſhipped upon the top of his Staff.</hi> Which is not the tranſlation of
<hi>Moſes</hi> his words in this place: But words of his own, whereby he explains the following Story; and ſhows how ſtrong his Faith was, when his Body was ſo weak that he was not able to bow himſelf and worſhip, without the help of his Staff. This clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly removes all the difficulty, which Interpreters have <pb n="592" facs="tcp:50230:304"/> made about reconciling the words of
<hi>Moſes</hi> here in this <hi>Verſe,</hi> to the Apoſtle's words in that.</p>
               <p>But however this be, <hi>Jacob</hi>'s bowing here, I doubt not, ſignifies worſhipping; as the <hi>Vulgar Latin</hi> takes it: Where the word <hi>God</hi> is added, (which is not in the <hi>Hebrew</hi>) and theſe words thus tranſlated, <hi>Iſrael worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped God, turning himſelf to the Bed's head.</hi>

               <p>

               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>For an everlaſting poſſeſſion.</hi>] We do not read this in either of the Appearances, in ſo many words: But he ſaid it in effect, when he told him, in the laſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance there, XXXV. 12.
<hi>The Land which I gave to Abraham, and Iſaac, to thee will I give it,</hi> &amp;c. Now he gave it to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed <hi>for ever,</hi> XIII. 15.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>And now thy two Sons,</hi> &amp;c.] Having aſſured him God would be as good as his Word, in giving the Land of

               <p>
                  <hi>Are mine.</hi>] Thy two Sons ſhall be reckoned as if I had begotten them: And accordingly have each of them an Inheritance, equal with the reſt of my Sons; and be diſtinct Tribes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As Reuben, and Simeon, ſhall they be mine.</hi>] He inſtances in them, becauſe they were his eldeſt Sons: Who, he ſays, ſhould have no more than <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manaſſeh.</hi> And, perhaps, the meaning may be; theſe two ſhall be accounted as the Firſt-born of my Family. For he gives <hi>Joſeph</hi> the Primogeniture, (who was indeed the Firſt-born of his firſt intended Wife) and beſtows a double Portion upon him; by making his two Sons equal to the reſt of his Children.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>And thy iſſue which thou begetteſt after them, ſhall be thine.</hi>] I will make no diſtinct Proviſion for them, as I have done for theſe two: But they <hi>ſhall be called after the Name of their Brethren in their Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi>

               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>And as for me, when I came from Padan-Aram, Rachel died by me,</hi> &amp;c.] He mentions her death (which doth not ſeem to belong to the foregoing diſcourſe) becauſe it hapned preſently after that laſt Promiſe in <hi>Bethel,</hi> (XXXV. 18.) and he thought it would be grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to his Son, to hear him remember his dear Mother. For it is as if he had ſaid; <hi>And now, my Son, this puts me in mind of thy Mother, who died immediately after that Promiſe of multiplying my Seed: And yet I ſee it fulfilled in thoſe Children which God hath given thee.</hi> Or, we may look upon theſe words, as giving the reaſon why he took <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> to be his own Children; and the Sence to be as if he had ſaid: <hi>Thy Mother indeed, and my beloved Wife, died ſoon after ſhe began to bear Children; when ſhe might have brought me many more: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I adopt theſe her Grand-Children,</hi> and look upon them as if they had been born of <hi>Rachel.</hi> And I do it in Memory and Honour of her;

And it is to be ſuppoſed he had not in his Travels, all things neceſſary to preſerve her Body long; by em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balming her, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> did him.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>And he kiſſed them,</hi> &amp;c.] Expreſſed the greateſt Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>Brought them out from between his Knees.</hi>] It appears by <hi>Verſe</hi> 2. that <hi>Jacob</hi> ſat upon his Bed; and his Legs hanging down, they kneeled between his Knees: From whence
<hi>Joſeph</hi> took them. And then ſeems to have placed himſelf in the ſame poſture, <hi>bowing himſelf with his Face to the Earth</hi> (as the following words tell us) to give his Father Thanks for his Kindneſs to his Children. Or, rather, we may conceive, that while <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> embraced them in his Arms, and kiſſed them with more than ordinary Affection,
<hi>Joſeph</hi> was afraid that they might lie too long, or preſs too hard upon his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Breaſt; and create ſome trouble to a feeble old Man: And therefore he withdrew them from thence, and diſpoſed them to receive his Bleſſing.</p>

                  <hi>What ſhall be in the laſt Days.</hi>] The Condition of your Poſterity in future Times. <hi>Jacob</hi> is the firſt, that we read of, who particularly declared the future ſtate of every one of his Sons, when he left the World. But it hath been an ancient Opinion, That the Souls of all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <pb n="601" facs="tcp:50230:308"/> Men, the nearer they approached to their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from hence, the more Divine they grew; and had a clearer proſpect of things to come. Whence <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon, L.</hi> VIII. makes his <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſay, when he was near his end, That <hi>the Souls of Men, at the point of death, become Prophetick.</hi> Which never was univerſally true; for Prophecy is not a natural thing; nor were all excellent Men partakers of it; and God communicated it in what meaſures he pleaſed, to thoſe who had any thing of it; and to <hi>Jacob</hi> more than had been beſtowed upon his great Anceſtors. For theſe laſt words of his, may be called <hi>Prophecies</hi> rather than <hi>Benedictions:</hi> Some of them containing no Bleſſing in them; but all of them Predictions.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>Gather your ſelves together.</hi>] This is repeated, to haſten them; as the two next words, <hi>hear</hi> and
<hi>hearken,</hi> are uſed to excite their attention. It was the manner of good Men among the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> to call all their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren before them, and give them good Counſel, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their Bleſſing, when they drew near to their end: The words then ſpoken, being likely to ſtick faſt in their Mind.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>Reuben,</hi> &amp;c.] It is commonly obſerved, that the Style wherein he ſpeaks to his Sons, is much more lofty than that hitherto uſed in this Book. Which hath made ſome fanſie that
<hi>Jacob</hi> did not deliver theſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry words; but <hi>Moſes</hi> put the Sence of what he ſaid into ſuch Poetical Expreſſions. But it ſeems more reaſonable to me, to think that the Spirit of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy now coming upon him, raiſed his Style as well as his Underſtanding: As it did
<hi>Moſes</hi>'s alſo; who deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered his Benedictions (in <hi>Deut.</hi> XXXIII.) in a ſtrain more ſublime, than his other Writings.</p>

The firſt of theſe, ſaith the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſt was given to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> the ſecond to <hi>Levi,</hi> the third to
<hi>Judah,</hi> becauſe <hi>Reuben</hi> had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited all the Rights of his Primogeniture, by his Inceſt with his Father's Wife. But Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> himſelf (who gives a full account of the <hi>Jews</hi> Opinion in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) acknowledges the Prieſthood was not confined to the Firſt-born before the Law, as appears by <hi>Abel</hi>'s offering Sacrifice as well as

<hi>Judg.</hi> I. 3, 17. and their Portion being too ſtrict for them, we read how in after-times they acquired Poſſeſſions, where they could, far from the reſt of their Brethren: <hi>Five hundred</hi> of this Tribe, under ſeveral Captains, going to Mount <hi>Seir,</hi> and there ſetling themſelves, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> IV. 39, 42.

               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>The Scepter ſhall not depart from Judah,</hi> &amp;c.] That the firſt word <hi>Schebet</hi> is rightly tranſlated
<hi>Scepter,</hi> 
                  <pb n="609" facs="tcp:50230:312"/> we have the unanimous Teſtimony of the three <hi>Targum's</hi> of the ancient Book <hi>Rabboth,</hi> with a great many of the modern <hi>Rabbins,</hi> (ſuch as <hi>Chaskuni, Bechai, Abarbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,</hi> &amp;c.) who all think the word ſignifies a
<hi>Scepter,</hi> and not a <hi>Tribe,</hi> as ſome few would have it: Whom ſome Chriſtians follow; particularly <hi>Jac. Altingius</hi> hath lately aſſerted it in his <hi>Schilo;</hi> but, in my judgment, againſt the cleareſt evidence for the other ſignification. For, as <hi>Schebet</hi> doth not originally ſignifie a <hi>Tribe,</hi> but a <hi>Rod</hi> or
<hi>Wand</hi> ſhooting from the Root of a Tree, (from whence it was tranſlated to ſignifie a <hi>Tribe,</hi> who ſpring out of a common Stock, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Father of the Family) ſo the <hi>Verſe</hi> foregoing being a plain Prediction of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi>'s Dominion, not only over external Enemies, but over his Brethren, what can we ſo reaſonably think to be the Deſign of this <hi>Verſe,</hi> as to foretell the Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and Duration of that great Power and Authority promiſed in the foregoing? It is obſervable alſo that the very ſame Phraſe is uſed, in this Sence, and cannot have another, <hi>Zachar.</hi> X. 11. <hi>The Scepter of Egypt ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part away:</hi> Where there are two of the words here uſed; ſignifying the Dominion, which the <hi>Egyptians</hi> then exerciſed over the poor
<hi>Jews,</hi> ſhould quite ceaſe. And if <hi>Moſes</hi> had meant a
<hi>Tribe</hi> in this place, he would not have ſaid the <hi>Tribe ſhall not depart from Judah,</hi> but the <hi>Tribe of Judah ſhall not ceaſe:</hi> For the former looks like a tautology.</p>
               <p>The meaning of this word then being ſetled, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
<hi>Jacob</hi> here gives <hi>Judah</hi> the higheſt Superiority over his Brethren; and informs them, that from the time his Authority ſhould be eſtabliſhed, they ſhould continue a Form of Government in this
<hi>Tribe,</hi> till the coming of the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> The word
<hi>Scepter</hi> is more uſed in ancient Times (as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> obſerves in his <hi>Titles of Honour</hi>) <pb n="610" facs="tcp:50230:313"/> to ſignifie Kingly Power, than either <hi>Crown</hi> or <hi>Diadem,</hi> which have been uſed more in latter times. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the LXX tranſlate it
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, of whoſe Authority the
<hi>Rod, Staff,</hi> or <hi>Scepter</hi> was the Enſign. And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly in the Prophecy of <hi>Amos</hi> I. 5. <hi>He that holdeth the Scepter,</hi> is uſed abſolutely for a <hi>King.</hi> Now this Regal Power began in the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> when <hi>David</hi> was King over all
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> XXVIII. 4. and his Poſterity held it, till the Captivity of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then the next word in this <hi>Verſe, Mechokek</hi> (which we tranſlate <hi>Law-giver</hi>) ſignifies a diminution of this Dignity, before the finiſhing of this Prophecy. For <hi>Mechokkim</hi> were not of equal Power with Kings; and therefore we tranſlate the word elſewhere
<hi>Governours, Judg.</hi> V. 9, 14. who were not indued with an abſolute Power, but depended on the Power of another. And thus <hi>R. Solomon Jarchi</hi> expreſly ſays (in his <hi>Commentaries</hi> on the
<hi>Sanhedrim</hi>) that as <hi>Schebet</hi> ſignifies the higheſt Authority, ſo <hi>Mechokek</hi> ſignifies a leſſer Magiſtrate or Ruler; who was ſet over the People by the Authority and Licence of the Kings of <hi>Perſia.</hi> For this kind of Power was ſetled among them, at their return from <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> when <hi>Zerobabel</hi> was made their Governor. And after they were invaded by the <hi>Seleucidae</hi> this Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was recovered and maintained by the <hi>Maccabees;</hi> till they were deprived of it by <hi>Herod</hi> and the <hi>Romans.</hi> At which time Chriſt came; when it is evident they were become Subjects to the <hi>Romans,</hi> by the very en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolling that was made of them at the Birth of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour: Which was a publick Teſtimony of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his Sovereignty over them. So that the meaning of this Prophecy is; <hi>There ſhall be either Kings, or Governors among the</hi> Jews <hi>till Chriſt come.</hi> So <hi>J. Chriſtoph. Wagen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeil</hi> (who hath diſcuſſed this place, with great exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) <pb n="611" facs="tcp:50230:313"/> gives the Sence of theſe words; and it is literally true; Till the Captivity they had Kings; after their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn they had Governors, under the <hi>Perſians, Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Romans.</hi> See his <hi>Confut. Carm. Memorialis Libri Nitzachon. R. Lipmanni, pag.</hi> 293, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To ſtrengthen which Interpretation he makes this ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Remark, in another place of the ſame Book, <hi>pag.</hi> 373. That the whole time, from the beginning to the end of <hi>Judah</hi>'s Authority, was well nigh equally divided between <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Governors.</hi> For, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Joſephus, L.</hi> XI. <hi>Antiq. cap.</hi> 4. they lived under Kings, from <hi>David</hi>'s time to the Captivity, <hi>Five hundred thirty two</hi> Years; and under the <hi>Mechokkim</hi> or <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors,</hi> after the Captivity, much about the ſame number of Years. For there being
<hi>Five hundred eighty and eight</hi> Years from the Captivity to our Saviour's Birth; if <hi>ſeventy</hi> Years be deducted (which was the time their Captivity laſted) and <hi>ten</hi> be added, (in which after the Birth of Chriſt, <hi>Herod</hi> and his Son <hi>Archelaus</hi> reigned in
<hi>Judaea,</hi> and it was not yet reduced into the form of a Province) there were juſt <hi>Five hundred twenty and eight</hi> Years; that is, the ſpace in which they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Kingly Authority, and under ſubordinate Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, was in a manner, of the ſame length. Which makes it the more wonderful, that
<hi>Jacob</hi> ſhould ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ages before exactly divide the whole Power he foreſaw would be in <hi>Judah,</hi> between them that wielded a Scepter; and thoſe who were only ſubordinate Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors.</p>
               <p>That the Letter <hi>Vau</hi> before the word we tranſlate
<hi>Law-giver,</hi> hath the force of a <hi>Disjunctive,</hi> and is not a mere
<hi>Copulative,</hi> all allow: And there are many Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of it in other places, particularly, in the Tenth <hi>Commandment, Exod.</hi> XX. 14. The greateſt Objection <pb n="612" facs="tcp:50230:314"/> that I can find againſt this Interpretation is, That though <hi>Zerobabel,</hi> the firſt
<hi>Governor</hi> after the Captivity, was of the Tribe of <hi>Judah;</hi> yet the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> who were their <hi>Governors</hi> moſt of the time after the Captivity, were of the Tribe of <hi>Levi.</hi> But it is to be conſidered, that the Prophecy doth not ſay theſe <hi>Rulers</hi> or
<hi>Governors,</hi> ſhould be of the Tribe of <hi>Judah;</hi> but only in that Tribe, which had a Government of their own, till the coming of Chriſt. Beſides, by <hi>Judah</hi> is not to be underſtood merely the People of that Tribe; but all thoſe that were called <hi>Jews,</hi> conſiſting alſo of the Tribes of <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin</hi> and <hi>Levi;</hi> who were incorporated with them: And were all called <hi>Judah,</hi> in oppoſition to the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> For <hi>Benjamin</hi> it is evident, was ſo near to <hi>Judah,</hi> that they were reputed the very ſame. Whence it is that <hi>Mordecai,</hi> who was of the Tribe of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> is called
<hi>Iſch Jehudi, a Jew,</hi> in <hi>Eſther</hi> II. 5. becauſe that Tribe was comprehended under <hi>Judah,</hi> from the time that the reſt rent themſelves from the Houſe of <hi>David.</hi> When <hi>Jeroboam</hi> alſo ſet up the meaneſt of the People for Prieſts; who were not of the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> XII. 33. This made the <hi>Levites</hi> fly to <hi>Judah</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one with them. And therefore the
<hi>Maccabees</hi> were, in effect, <hi>Jews,</hi> who held the chief Authority a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, till <hi>Antigonus</hi> was driven out and killed by
<hi>Herod:</hi> Who was an <hi>Edomite,</hi> ſet over them by the

<hi>Ludolphus</hi> inſtead of <hi>Raglau,</hi> Feet, would have us read
<hi>Daglau,</hi> Banners, according to the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Copy. Which is well confuted by the fore-named <hi>Wagenſeil, p.</hi> 269. of the fore-named Book: Where he tranſlates theſe words thus, <hi>Even to the laſt end of that State.</hi> For ſo the <pb n="613" facs="tcp:50230:314"/> People <hi>at the Feet</hi> ſignifies (<hi>Exod.</hi> XI. 8. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> III. 9.) thoſe that bring up the Rear, as we now ſpeak.

<hi>The People of the Nations ſhall be gathered to worſhip him,</hi> i. e. the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> See <hi>L' Empereur</hi> in <hi>Jacchiad. p.</hi>
164. and <hi>Codex Middoth, p.</hi> 106, 107. <hi>Wagenſeil</hi> indeed thinks the moſt literal Interpretation to be this, <hi>To him ſhall be the Obedience of the People:</hi> Which is the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of <hi>Onkelos</hi> and the <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> Paraphraſt. <hi>Kimchi</hi> alſo (<hi>Lib.

<hi>Prov.</hi> XXX. 17. which is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly place beſides this, where this word <hi>Jikkah</hi> is found, it ſeems to ſignifie Obedience.</p>
               <p>See <hi>Confut. Carm. R. Lipmanni, p.</hi> 295. where
<hi>Wagen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeil</hi> after the examination of every particular word in this

               <p>
                  <hi>That Royal Power and Authority which ſhall be eſtabliſhed in the Poſterity of Judah, ſhall not be taken from them; or, at leaſt, they ſhall not be deſtitute of Rulers and Governors, no not when they are in their declining Condition: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntil the coming of the Meſſiah. But when he is come, there ſhall be no difference between the</hi> Jews <hi>and other Nations: <pb n="615" facs="tcp:50230:315"/> Who ſhall all be obedient unto the Meſſiah. And after that the Poſterity of</hi> Judah
<hi>ſhall have neither King, nor Ruler of their own: But the whole Commonwealth of</hi> Judah <hi>ſhall quite loſe all Form; and never recover it again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Truth of this Expoſition appears exactly from their Hiſtory: Of which it will be uſeful here to give an account. For from
<hi>David</hi> to the Captivity of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> they held the
<hi>Scepter,</hi> for <hi>five</hi> whole Ages and more, as I obſerved above. After which, when <hi>ſeventy</hi> Years were finiſhed in that Captivity, they lived by their own Laws in their own Country: But had no abſolute Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of their own, independent upon others; nor ever enjoyed a full Liberty. For they were at firſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchs: Afterwards, upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt made by <hi>Alexander,</hi> under the
<hi>Greeks:</hi> And then under the Kings of <hi>Aſia Minor</hi> and
<hi>Egypt;</hi> till the <hi>Roman</hi> Yoke was impoſed upon them. Yet all this time, while they were under the Empire of others, they enjoyed
<hi>Governors</hi> or <hi>Rulers</hi> of their own: Who adminiſtred their Affairs, under thoſe Monarchs. The firſt was <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robabel,</hi> called the <hi>Captain,</hi> or <hi>Prince of Judah, Haggai</hi> I. 1. After him
<hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah.</hi> And before them it is likely there were ſome others, as <hi>Joſ. Scaliger</hi> gathers from <hi>Nehem.</hi> V. 15. After the death of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> the Government came into the Hands of the High-Prieſts, as appears from <hi>Joſephus, L.</hi> XI. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. where he ſhows how <hi>Jaddus</hi> the High-Prieſt met <hi>Alexander</hi> in his Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition againſt <hi>Perſia:</hi> Which Power was confirmed in that Order, by the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> as we commonly call them. It began in
<hi>Mattathias;</hi> and was continued in his Sons. The third of which,
<hi>Simon,</hi> raiſed it to ſuch a Splendor, that he looked like a
<hi>Prince,</hi> as the Reader may ſee it deſcribed in 1 <hi>Maccab.</hi> XIV. From whence his Grand-Child <hi>Ariſtobulus</hi> ſeems to have taken occaſion to affect <pb n="616" facs="tcp:50230:316"/> the Name of <hi>King:</hi> Though he had but the Shadow of that Power. Yet his Poſterity kept that Name, to the time of <hi>Herod:</hi> Who ſtript them of all their Power, and deſtroyed their Family. After his death the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was divided by <hi>Auguſtus</hi> into <hi>Tetrarchies: Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi> being made <hi>Tetrarch</hi> of
<hi>Judaea;</hi> and the reſt of the Country divided between <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Antipas.</hi> But <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelaus</hi> misbehaving himſelf, he was deprived of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and baniſhed to <hi>Vienne</hi> in
<hi>France:</hi> And then <hi>Judaea</hi> was reduced into the Form of a Province, and ruled by <hi>Roman</hi> Governors. After which there was no
<hi>King,</hi> nor <hi>Ethnarch</hi> of <hi>Judaea:</hi> So that after this time we may ſafely conclude, the <hi>Jews</hi> loſt even their
<hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chokkim</hi> or Governors; as they had long ago loſt the
<hi>Scepter:</hi> And had no Power remaining among them, of adminiſtring the Affairs of their Commonwealth.</p>
               <p>Now at this time our bleſſed Lord and Saviour,
<hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> Chriſt, the true <hi>Shiloh</hi> came: Who was the Founder of a new and heavenly Kingdom. And nothing more was left to be done for the fulfilling of this Prophecy, but after his Crucifying, to deſtroy
<hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the <hi>Temple,</hi> and therewith the whole Form of their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, both Civil and Sacred. Then all Power was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely taken from <hi>Judah,</hi> when Chriſt had erected his Throne in the Heavens, and brought many People, in ſeveral Parts of the Earth, unto his Obedience, and made them Members of his Celeſtial Kingdom. Till which time this Prophecy was not compleatly fulfilled: Which may be the reaſon poſſibly, that it is not alledged by Chriſt and his Apoſtles; becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> might have ſaid, We have ſtill a Government among us: Which could not be pretended after the deſtruction by <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</hi> Which is now above
<hi>Sixteen hundred</hi> Years ago: And there is not the leaſt ſign of their reſtitution. <pb n="617" facs="tcp:50230:316"/> Which ſo perplexed <hi>R. Samuel Maroccanus</hi> that it made him write thus to a Friend of his, above <hi>Six hundred</hi> Years ſince.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I would fain learn from thee, out of the Teſtimonies of the Law, and the Prophets, and other Scriptures, why the</hi> Jews <hi>are thus ſmitten in this Captivity wherein we are: Which may be properly called, the PERPET<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>AL ANGER OF GOD, becauſe it hath no end. For it is now above a Thouſand Years, ſince we were carried cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive by</hi> TITUS; <hi>and yet our Fathers who worſhipped Idols, kill'd the Prophets, and caſt the Law behind their Back, were only puniſhed with a Seventy Years Captivity, and then brought home again: But now there is no end of our Calamities, nor do the Prophets promiſe any.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If this Argument was hard to be anſwered then in his Days, it is much harder now in ours: Who ſtill ſee them purſued by God's Vengeance; which can be for nothing elſe but rejecting, and crucifying the
<hi>Meſſiah,</hi> the Saviour of the World.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>Binding his Foal unto the Vine,</hi> &amp;c.] This
<hi>Verſe</hi> ſets forth the great Fertility of <hi>Judah</hi>'s Country (abounding with Vineyards and Paſtures) by two Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbolical Expreſſions.
<hi>Firſt,</hi> That Vines ſhould be as common there, as Thorn-Hedges in other places; ſo that they might tie Aſſes, with their Colts to them: Or, as ſome will have it, lade an Aſs with the Fruit of one Vine.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> That Wine ſhould be as common as Water; ſo that they ſhould have enough, not only to drink, but to waſh their Clothes in it. Which doth not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that they made it ſerve for that uſe; but only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes its plenty: Which was ſo very great, that in tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Grapes, and preſſing out the Juice, their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were all ſprinkled with Wine; which one might wring out of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="618" facs="tcp:50230:317"/>
                  <hi>Choice Vine.</hi>] The Vine of
<hi>Sorek</hi> (which we here tranſlate <hi>choice,</hi> and in
<hi>Jerem.</hi> II. 21. <hi>noble</hi> Vine) was the moſt excellent in all that Country. For <hi>Sorek</hi> was a place, not above half a Mile from the Valley of <hi>Eſchol;</hi> from whence the Spies brought the large Bunches, as a Sample of the Fruitfulneſs of the Country. See <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chart. P.</hi> I.

               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>His Eyes ſhall be red with Wine,</hi> &amp;c.] This <hi>Verſe</hi> ſets forth the Healthfulneſs and Vigour of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of that fertile Country. But Dr. <hi>Caſtell</hi> thinks this not to be a good Tranſlation; becauſe it can be ſaid of none but a Drunkard, that his <hi>Eyes are red with Wine.</hi> And therefore it ought to be tranſlated <hi>his Eyes</hi> (or <hi>his Countenance,</hi> for ſo
<hi>Eyes</hi> ſometimes ſignifies) ſhall be <hi>brighter</hi> and more
<hi>ſhining than Wine.</hi> So the word we render <hi>red</hi> ſignifies in the <hi>Arabick</hi> Tongue, as he ſhows in his <hi>Oratio in Schol. Theolog. p.</hi> 31. and in his <hi>Lexicon.</hi> Yet the ſame word in the
<hi>Proverbs,</hi> XXIII. 29. cannot have any other ſignification than
<hi>red;</hi> and the <hi>red</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the Eyes, anſwers well here to the <hi>whiteneſs</hi> of the Teeth, which follows; and there is no more reaſon to think he means, they ſhould make their Eyes red with drinking Wine, than that they ſhould <hi>waſh their Clothes</hi> in it: But it may only expreſs the great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Wine; to ſerve not only their neceſſity, but exceſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And his Teeth white with Milk.</hi>] Milk doth not make the Teeth white; but gives ſuch an excellent Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that they who live upon it are healthy and ſtrong: And their Teeth not ſo apt to rot, as theirs who feed upon greater Dainties. So the meaning is, the rich Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures in that Country, ſhould feed great Flocks, and conſequently they ſhould have abundance of Milk, ſo good and nouriſhing, that the Teeth of the Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men <pb n="619" facs="tcp:50230:317"/> who lived upon it, ſhould be as white as the Milk they drank. Or, if the foregoing words be tranſlated, <hi>His Eyes ſhall be brighter than Wine;</hi> theſe are to be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated, <hi>His Teeth whiter than Milk.</hi>

               <p>Out of theſe <hi>three Verſes</hi> foregoing,

               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>Zebulon ſhall dwell at the Haven of the Sea.</hi>] Near the Lake of <hi>Tiberias;</hi> called in Scripture the <hi>Sea of Gallilee.</hi>

                  <hi>His Border ſhall be unto Zidon.</hi>] He doth not mean the City of <hi>Zidon;</hi> for the Tribe of <hi>Zebulon</hi> did not extend themſelves beyond Mount <hi>Carmel,</hi> which is <hi>forty</hi> Miles at leaſt from thence: But the Country of <hi>Zidon,</hi> i. e.
<hi>Phoenicia,</hi> (as <hi>Bochart</hi> obſerves in his <hi>Phaleg, L.</hi> IV. <hi>cap.</hi> 34.) which the <hi>Zebulonites</hi> touched. For as the
<hi>Phoenicians</hi> were called <hi>Syrians</hi> from <hi>Sur,</hi> i. e.

               <p>It is very much to be admired, That <hi>Jacob</hi> ſhould foretell ſo many Years before-hand, the Situation of his Poſterity in the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> when their ſeveral Portions fell to them by Lot, and not by their own choice, <hi>Joſh.</hi> XIX. 10, 11. This could not have been, but by the Spirit of Prophecy. And it is remarkable alſo, that he mentions <hi>Zebulon</hi> before <hi>Iſſachar,</hi> who was his elder Brother, (XXX. 11.) for no other reaſon, that I can diſcern, but becauſe
<hi>Zebulon</hi>'s Lot was to come up before <hi>Iſſachar</hi>'s, in the Diviſion of the Land: His be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb n="620" facs="tcp:50230:318"/> the <hi>third,</hi> and <hi>Iſſachar</hi>'s the <hi>fourth, Joſh.</hi> XIX. 10, 17. By this they were taught that their Habitation in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> was the Gift of God; and did not come by chance: Their Fore-father having ſo long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, predicted the very Portion they ſhould inherit.</p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>Iſſachar is a ſtrong Aſs.</hi>] As he compared <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> to a <hi>Lion,</hi> becauſe of his Valour, ſo he compares <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachar</hi> to an <hi>Aſs,</hi> and a <hi>ſtrong Aſs,</hi> becauſe he foreſaw they would be very patient and unwearied in ruſtical Labours: In which Aſſes were principally employed in thoſe Countries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Couching down between two burdens.</hi>] There are vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Opinions about the ſignification of that word, which we tranſlate
<hi>Burdens.</hi> But none ſeem to me ſo apt as that, to expreſs the great ſtrength of an Aſs: Which lies down, with its Load hanging down on both ſides. Whence a ſhe Aſs is called <hi>Athon</hi> (as
<hi>Bochart</hi> obſerves) from the word <hi>Ethan;</hi> which ſignifies
<hi>ſtrength:</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no Beaſt of that bigneſs can carry ſuch heavy Burdens.</p>
               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>And he ſaw that reſt was good.</hi>] Or, as ſome will have it, their <hi>reſting place;</hi> the Country that fell to their ſhare in the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> no part of which was more fruitful, than ſome parts of <hi>Iſſachar</hi>'s Portion. Which way ſoever we take it, he ſeems to foretell they would chuſe to follow Husbandry rather than Merchandice (as <hi>Zebulon</hi> did) and love Quiet and Peace, as Husbandmen do: Eſpecially when they live in a rich Soil, as this Tribe did. For ſo it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the Land that it was pleaſant.</hi> The famous Valley of <hi>Jezreel</hi> was in this Tribe: Whoſe Border extended as far as

                  <hi>And became a Servant unto Tribute.</hi>] Submitting to the heavieſt Taxes, rather than loſe their Repoſe. For the preſervation of which they were content to give any Money; that they might redeem their Services in the Wars, or otherways, by large Contributions.</p>
               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>Dan ſhall judge his People,</hi> &amp;c.] In the word <hi>Judge</hi> he alludes to the Name of <hi>Dan:</hi> Which ſignifies
<hi>Judging,</hi> i. e. Ruling and Governing. A great many follow
<hi>Onkelos,</hi> who expounds it thus; <hi>A Man ſhall ariſe out of the Tribe of Dan, in whoſe Days the People ſhall be delivered,</hi> &amp;c. And accordingly we read that <hi>Sampſon,</hi> who was of this Tribe judged
<hi>Iſrael</hi> twenty Years. So the meaning is, the Tribe of <hi>Dan</hi> ſhall have the Honour to produce a <hi>Judge,</hi> as well as other Tribes. But there is this exception to this Interpretation; that all the Tribes did not produce <hi>Judges:</hi> And all <hi>Iſrael</hi> (whom the <hi>Judges</hi> governed) cannot be ſaid to be <hi>Dan</hi>'s Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. But by <hi>his People</hi> (whom he is ſaid here to judge) are properly meant thoſe of his Tribe. And therefore <hi>Jacob</hi>'s meaning is, that though he were the Son of a Concubine, yet his Poſterity ſhould be governed by a Head of their own Tribe; as the other Tribes of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> were. So by this he took away all diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Sons of his Concubines (of whom <hi>Dan</hi> was the firſt) and thoſe which he had by <hi>Leah</hi> and
<hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>Dan ſhall be a Serpent by the way.</hi>] The next words ſhow, what kind of Serpent he ſhould be like, <hi>an Adder in the Path.</hi> The <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <hi>Schephiphon,</hi> ſome take for a
<hi>Baſilisk;</hi> others for an <hi>Aſp,</hi> or a <hi>Viper;</hi> others a <hi>Snake,</hi> or <hi>Adder,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Vulgar</hi> tranſlates it <pb n="622" facs="tcp:50230:319"/> 
                  <hi>Ceraſtes,</hi> which is a kind of Viper: And
<hi>Bochartus</hi> (in his <hi>Hierozoicon, P.</hi> II. <hi>L.</hi> III.
<hi>c.</hi> 12.) hath confirmed this Tranſlation; by ſhowing how well it agrees to the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters which Authors give of it: That it lies in Sand, and in the Ruts, which Cart-Wheels make in the High-way; and ſo is ready to bite Travellers, or their Horſes. Which is the harder to be avoided, becauſe it is of a Sandy Colour; ſo that <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, many tread upon it unawares: And <hi>Nicander</hi> ſays, the Poiſon of theſe Serpents is chiefly felt in the Thighs and Hams of thoſe they bite. Which perfectly agrees with what <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaith in the following words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That biteth the Horſe-heels, ſo that his rider ſhall fall backward.</hi>] The Horſe not being able to ſtand, when the Venom works in his Legs, the Rider muſt needs fall with him. All this ſome make to be a deſcription of <hi>Sampſon,</hi> who led no Armies againſt his Enemies, but overthrew them by Subtilty and Craft. But it rather belongs to all the <hi>Danites</hi> (as what was ſaid before to all the <hi>Zebulonites</hi> and <hi>Iſſacharians</hi>) who <hi>Jacob</hi> foreſaw would, <hi>aſtu potius, quam aperto Marte rem gerere,</hi> manage their Wars, rather by Cunning and Craft, than by open Hoſtility, as <hi>Bochart</hi> ſpeaks. An Example of which we have in <hi>Judg.</hi> XVIII. 27.</p>
               <p>Ver. 18. <hi>I have waited for thy Salvation, O LORD.</hi>] They that referr the foregoing words to <hi>Sampſon,</hi> make an eaſie Interpretation of this <hi>Verſe.</hi> Which is, That <hi>Jacob</hi> foreſeeing his great Atchievements for the Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance of his Children, prays that God would upon all Occaſions, vouchſafe to ſend ſuch Deliverers unto them, from their Oppreſſors. And the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſts make him look beyond ſuch Deliverers unto Chriſt, the great Saviour of the World. For theſe are the words of <hi>Onkelos</hi> (in the
<hi>Complutenſian</hi> Edition, for they are <pb n="623" facs="tcp:50230:319"/> not to be found in <hi>Buxtorf</hi>'s or <hi>Bomberg</hi>'s) <hi>I do not wait for the Salvation of</hi> Gideon, <hi>the Son of</hi> Joaſh, <hi>which is temporal Salvation, or of</hi> Sampſon <hi>the Son of</hi> Manoah, <hi>which is alſo a tranſitory Salvation; but I expect the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Chriſt, the Son of</hi> David, <hi>&amp;c. Jonathan</hi> and the <hi>Hieruſalem Targum</hi> ſay the ſame. And if we take all this Porphecy to belong to the whole Tribe, (as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it doth) that doth not exclude ſuch a Sence. But
<hi>Jacob</hi> foreſeeing the Diſtreſſes wherein they would be, (<hi>Joſh.</hi> XIX. 47. <hi>Judg.</hi> I. 34.) prays God to help them, and deliver them, and teach them to look up to him in all their Straits and Neceſſities: And eſpecially to wait for the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> Yet after all, I think, the words may have another meaning, which is this.
<hi>Jacob</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving his approaching death, and his Spirits beginning to fail him, in the middle of his Speech to his Sons, breaks out into this Exclamation, (which belongs to none of them) ſaying, <hi>I wait, O LORD, for a happy Deliverance out of this World, into a better Place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then having reſted himſelf a while, to recover his Strength, he proceeded to bleſs the reſt of his Sons.</p>
               <p>Ver. 19. <hi>Gad, a Troop ſhall overcome him.</hi>] Or, invade him. There is an Alluſion in every Word to the Name of <hi>Gad:</hi> Whoſe Inheritance being in a Frontier Country beyond <hi>Jordan,</hi> was very much expoſed to the Incurſions of the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> and <hi>Moabites,</hi> and the reſt of thoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Neighbours, that dwelt in or near
<hi>Arabia.</hi> And ſome think the word <hi>Troop</hi> hath a great Propriety in it; ſignifying not a juſt Army, but a Party, as we ſpeak, a Band of Men, that came oft-times, to rob and ſpoil. But it appears by the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> XLIX. 1. that the <hi>Ammonites</hi> ſometime poſſeſſed themſelves of the Country of <hi>Gad,</hi> or, at leaſt, of ſome part of it, and <pb n="624" facs="tcp:50230:320"/> exerciſed great Cruelties there, <hi>Amos</hi> I. 13.

                  <hi>But he ſhall overcome at the laſt.</hi>] This was eminently fulfilled, when <hi>Jephtha</hi> the <hi>Gileadite,</hi> fought with the Children of <hi>Ammon,</hi> and <hi>ſubdued them before the Children of Iſrael, Judg.</hi> XI. 33. and when this Tribe (together with their Brethren of <hi>Reuben</hi> and <hi>Manaſſeh</hi>) made War with the
<hi>Hagarites,</hi> and poſſeſſed themſelves of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: Which they kept till the Captivity, <hi>becauſe the War was of God,</hi> 1
<hi>Chron.</hi> V. 22.</p>
               <p>Ver. 20. <hi>Out of Aſher.</hi>] <hi>i. e.</hi> Of his Country.</p>

                  <hi>His Bread ſhall be fat.</hi>] Shall be excellent Proviſion, of all ſorts, for the ſuſtenance of humane Life. For
<hi>Bread</hi> comprehends not only Corn, but Wine and Oil, and all ſorts of Victuals, XXI. 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he ſhall yield royal dainties.</hi>] His Country ſhall afford not only all things neceſſary; but the choiceſt Fruits, fit to be ſerved up to the Table of Kings. For part of it lay about
<hi>Carmel,</hi> (<hi>Joſh.</hi> XIX. 26.) where there was a moſt delicious Valley.</p>
               <p>Ver. 21. <hi>Naphtali is a Hind let looſe.</hi>] As he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared <hi>Judah</hi> to a <hi>Lion,</hi> and <hi>Iſſachar</hi> to an
<hi>Aſs,</hi> and <hi>Dan</hi> to a <hi>Serpent;</hi> ſo he compares this Son to a <hi>Hind,</hi> which is not confined within Pales or Walls: But runs at large, whither it pleaſeth. Whereby is ſignified that this Tribe would be great lovers of Liberty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He giveth goodly</hi> (or <hi>pleaſing</hi>)
<hi>words.</hi>] Which denotes their Addreſs (as we now ſpeak) charming Language, and Affability, to win the Favour of others: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by preſerve their Peace and Liberty. <hi>Mercer</hi> makes this <hi>Verſe</hi> to ſignifie their ſpeed and ſwiftneſs in diſpatch <pb n="625" facs="tcp:50230:320"/> of Buſineſs; and their ſmoothneſs in the management of it: Which might render them acceptable to all Men. There are no Inſtances indeed in Scripture to make out this Character: For <hi>Barak</hi> who was of this Tribe was very ſlow in undertaking the Deliverance of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Nor do we read they were more zealous Aſſertors of Liberty than others. But yet this will not warrant us to alter the punctation of the words (as <hi>Bochart</hi> doth
<hi>P.</hi> I. <hi>Hierozoic. L.</hi> III. <hi>cap.</hi> 18.) to make a quite different Sence, which is this. <hi>Naphtali is a well-ſpred Tree, which puts out beautiful Branches.</hi> For we do not find that they were either more beautiful, or numerous than other Tribes: But we find, quite contrary, that
<hi>Simeon, Judah, Iſſachar, Zebulon,</hi> and <hi>Dan,</hi> were all more numerous than they when <hi>Moſes</hi> took an account of them,
<hi>Numb.</hi> I. 23, 27, 29, 31, 39. Beſides, this Interpretation makes this
<hi>Verſe,</hi> in a manner, the very ſame with the next, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Joſeph.</hi> Therefore though the LXX agree to <hi>Bochart</hi>'s Verſion, we had better ſtick to our own; which makes a Sence clear and proper enough.</p>
               <p>Ver. 22. <hi>Joſeph is a fruitful Bough.</hi>] Or, young Plant. It is an Alluſion to his Name; which imports growth and increaſe: And may well be underſtood of the great Dignity to which he was riſen in
<hi>Egypt.</hi> Unto which he was advanced in a ſhort time, after
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of him: Like a Bough or young Plant, which ſhoots up apace; and thence compared in the next words to</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A fruitful Bough by a well.</hi>] Or, Spring of Water: Which in thoſe dry Countries, made the Plants which were ſet near them, to grow the faſter, and to a greater heighth, (<hi>Pſalm</hi> I. 3.) and therefore ſignifies his extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary advancement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whoſe Branches run over the Wall.</hi>] Cover the Wall that ſurrounds the Spring; or, the Wall againſt which <pb n="626" facs="tcp:50230:321"/> the Tree is planted. Which ſeems to denote the two Tribes of
<hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manaſſeh;</hi> which ſprang from him, and were very flouriſhing: As appears from <hi>Joſh.</hi> XVII. 14, 17. where they tell him, they were <hi>a great People,</hi> whom the <hi>LORD had bleſſed hitherto.</hi> And <hi>Joſhua</hi> there acknowledges as much, ſaying,
<hi>Thou art a great People, and haſt great Power:</hi> And therefore aſſigns them a larger Portion of Land, than they had at firſt. The
<hi>Hebrew</hi> word <hi>Banoth,</hi> which we tranſlate <hi>Boughs,</hi> literally ſignifying <hi>Daughters;</hi> ſome think that as he ſpeaks of the <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>Joſeph</hi> in the foregoing part of the
<hi>Verſe;</hi> ſo in this he ſpeaks of his <hi>Daughters</hi> that they ſhould <hi>go to the Wall,</hi> i. e. ſaith Dr. <hi>Lightfoot, even to the Enemy:</hi> To repair the Hoſtile Tribe of <hi>Benjamin;</hi> which otherwiſe had decayed for want of Wives. For ſo the word <hi>Schur</hi> ſignifies, and is tranſlated by us an <hi>Enemy, Pſalm</hi> XCII. 11. And
<hi>D. Chytraeus</hi> underſtands hereby <hi>Daughters,</hi> the
<hi>Cities</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Ephraim</hi> which ſhould be well governed, though ſome ſhould ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt it.</p>
               <p>Ver. 23. <hi>The Archers.</hi> In the <hi>Hebrew</hi> the words
<hi>Baale chitſim</hi> ſignifie Maſters in the Art of Shooting; and therefore denotes thoſe here ſpoken of, to be skilful in doing Miſchief: Such were his Brethren, who were full not only of Envy, but Hatred to him, XXXVIII. 4, 5, 11. Some referr it alſo to <hi>Potiphar</hi>'s Wife; who wickedly ſlandred him. And others to the whole Tribe of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim;</hi> who were incompaſſed with <hi>Enemies</hi> (who in general are meant by
<hi>Archers</hi>) when the Kingdom was ſetled in them, over the ten Tribes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Have ſorely grieved him.</hi>] By their unkind, or rather churliſh Behaviour towards him; for <hi>they could not ſpeak peaceably to him,</hi> (XXXVIII. 4.) and, it's like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they reviled him, and threw out bitter words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <pb n="627" facs="tcp:50230:321"/> him: Which are properly compared to <hi>Arrows, Pſalm</hi> LXIV. 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſhot at him.</hi>] Deſigned to deſtroy him; and did actually throw him into ſore Afflictions, XXXVIII. 22, 24, 28.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And hated him.</hi>] Which aroſe from their hatred to him.</p>
               <p>Ver. 24. <hi>But his Bow abode in ſtrength.</hi>] He armed himſelf with invincible Patience; having nothing elſe to oppoſe unto their malicious contrivances. It ſeems to be a Metaphor from thoſe Soldiers, who have Bows ſo well made, that though often, never ſo often bent, they neither break, nor grow weak. Such was the Temper of
<hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the Arms of his Hands were made ſtrong.</hi>] <hi>i. e.</hi> He was ſtrengthned and ſupported: Being like to a ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous Archer, the Muſcles and Sinews of whoſe Arms are ſo firm and compact, that though his Hands draw his Bow continually, he is not weary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By the Hands of the mighty God of Jacob.</hi>] Which Fortitude he had not from himſelf, but from the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty; who had ſupported <hi>Jacob</hi> in all his Adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and made all that
<hi>Joſeph</hi> did (when he was ſold and impriſoned) to proſper in his Hands, XXXIX. 3, 22, 23. The <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <hi>Abir;</hi> which ſignifies <hi>Potent</hi> or Powerful, and we tranſlate <hi>mighty One,</hi> is as much as <hi>the LORD of Jacob.</hi> For from Power it comes to ſignifie <hi>Poteſtas,</hi> Authority and Dominion alſo, as
<hi>Bochart</hi> obſerves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>From thence.</hi>] From the Divine Providence over him, before mentioned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Is the Shepherd.</hi>] <hi>Joſeph</hi> became the Feeder and Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſher of his Father, and of his Family, and of their Flocks and Herds: Preſerving them all from being famiſhed.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>And the Stone of Iſrael.</hi>] Who upheld them all, and kept them from being ruin'd. Or, <hi>Shepherd</hi> may ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his being made Governor of all the Land of <hi>Egypt; and the Stone of Iſrael,</hi> the ſupport of his Family. For <hi>Shepherd</hi> is a Name of Dignity and Authority: And <hi>Stone</hi> ſignifies <hi>the Foundation</hi> (as <hi>Abarbinel</hi> here expounds it) upon which the whole Building relies: As <hi>Jacob</hi> and all his Children did upon
<hi>Joſeph</hi> for their ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
               <p>Some I find (particularly <hi>D. Chytraeus</hi>) referr the words <hi>from thence</hi> unto <hi>Joſeph:</hi> And then by <hi>the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd and Stone of Iſrael</hi> underſtand thoſe excellent Men, who by their Wiſdom and Valour ſupported the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Such as <hi>Joſhua,</hi> the Captain of the Lord's Hoſt, and
<hi>Abdon,</hi> one of the Judges, who were of the Tribe of <hi>Ephraim:</hi> And <hi>Gideon, Jair,</hi> and <hi>Jeph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thah,</hi> who were of the Tribe of
<hi>Manaſſeh.</hi> But the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words incline rather to the former Sence.</p>
               <p>Ver. 25. <hi>Even by the God of thy Father.</hi>] Or,
<hi>from</hi> him that bleſſed me; and advanced thee, to be the Support of my Family. For it referrs to all that went before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Who ſhall help thee.</hi>] Having ſaid what God had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done for him; he now foretells what he would do hereafter: Which relates to all his Poſterity; whom God would Protect and Defend.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And by the Almighty.</hi>] Or, from him who is
<hi>all-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient;</hi> by which Name he revealed himſelf unto
<hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> when he entred into Covenant with him and with his Seed, XVII. 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And bleſs thee with the bleſſings of heaven above, bleſſings of the deep that lieth under.</hi>] The meaning ſeems to be, that his Poſterity ſhould be planted in a very fertile Soil: Watred from above with the Dew of Heaven and with Showers of Rain; and watred beneath with
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:50230:322"/> Springs and Rivers. As <hi>G. Voſſius</hi> well interprets it, <hi>Lib.</hi> I. <hi>de Idolol. cap.</hi> 77.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bleſſings of the Breaſts, and of the Womb.</hi>] A promiſe of a numerous and thriving Progeny. Or, of a vaſt increaſe of Cattle, ſo well fed, that they ſhould bring up their Young proſperouſly, as well as bring them forth abundantly.</p>
               <p>Ver. 26. <hi>The bleſſings of thy Father.</hi>] Either the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings beſtowed by God upon <hi>Jacob;</hi> or, the Bleſſings
<hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> conferred on his Son <hi>Joſeph.</hi>

<hi>Canaan;</hi> whereas <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was excluded by <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> by <hi>Iſaac.</hi> Or, the meaning may be, <hi>I have done more for thee, than they for me,</hi> i. e. thou ſhalt be happier than I. For <hi>Jacob</hi> led an unſetled life; but <hi>Joſeph</hi> flouriſhed in great Splendor in <hi>Egypt,</hi> to the end of his days.</p>

<hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Children, <hi>viz. Baſhan</hi> and Mount
<hi>Ephraim.</hi> But there are thoſe who think, he hath not reſpect to the durableneſs of theſe Mountains; but to their fruitfulneſs; tranſlating the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <hi>Tavath</hi> not <hi>Bounds,</hi> but
<hi>Deſires,</hi> as the <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Latin</hi> doth. And then the Sence is,
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto all that is moſt deſirable, in thoſe ancient Hills;</hi> Which abounded with the moſt excellent Fruit. And this Tranſlation is grounded on
<hi>Moſes</hi> his Bleſſing, which ſeems to be an <pb n="630" facs="tcp:50230:323"/> Interpretation of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s, <hi>Deut.</hi> XXXIII. 15. where he bleſſes him; <hi>for the chief things of the ancient Mountains, and for the precious things of the laſting Hills.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of him that was ſeparate from his Brethren.</hi>] The word
<hi>Nazir,</hi> which we tranſlate <hi>ſeparate;</hi> ſignifies one that is ſeparated from others, <hi>vel Voto, vel Dignitate,</hi> (as
<hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chart</hi> obſerves, <hi>P.</hi> II. <hi>Hierozoic. L.</hi> V.
<hi>cap.</hi> 6.) <hi>either by a Vow, or by his Dignity.</hi> And in the latter Sence <hi>Joſeph</hi> is called <hi>Nazir,</hi> becauſe of his eminent Dignity; whereby he was advanced above all his Brethren: Being the Vice-Roy of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 27. <hi>Benjamin ſhall raven as a Wolf.</hi>] This ſets forth the warlike Temper of this Tribe: A Wolf being both a ſtrong and undaunted, and alſo a very rapacious Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: And thence in after-times dedicated to <hi>Mars.</hi> From whence Wolves are called <hi>Martii</hi> and
<hi>Martiales</hi> in <hi>Virgil</hi> and in <hi>Horace:</hi> And warlike Men are called by the <hi>Greeks</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, of a Wolf-like Temper. And the Hiſtory juſtifies this Character: The Tribe of <hi>Benjamin</hi> alone maintaining a War with all the other Tribes; in which they overcame them in two Battles, though they had ſixteen to one againſt them. And they killed then more Men of
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> than they had in their whole Army. See <hi>Bochart, P.</hi> I. <hi>Hierozoic. L.</hi> III. <hi>cap.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the morning he ſhall devour the prey, and at night he ſhall divide the Spoil.</hi> This doth not ſignifie (as the fore-named Author obſerves, in the ſame place) the whole <hi>Day,</hi> but the whole
<hi>Night:</hi> One part of which is the <hi>Evening,</hi> and the other the
<hi>Morning.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Particle <hi>and</hi> ſignifies here as much as <hi>after:</hi> And this is the Sence. <hi>The Tribe</hi> Benjamin
<hi>ſhall be like a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening Wolf: Who ſhall have his Prey to eat till Morning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; after he hath divided it in the Evening.</hi> For the diviſion of the Prey, goes before the eating of it. This <pb n="631" facs="tcp:50230:323"/> Paſſage is like that <hi>Joſh.</hi> VII. 25. <hi>They burnt them with Fire, and ſtoned them with Stones,</hi> i. e. burnt them, after they had ſtoned them; as we there rightly tranſlate it. And this applied to
<hi>Benjamin,</hi> ſignifies ſuch ſucceſs in their Wars, that they ſhould come home loaded with the Spoils of their Enemies.</p>
               <p>I omit the fancy of the <hi>Talmudiſts,</hi> who imagine
<hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin</hi> is compared to a <hi>Wolf;</hi> becauſe the Altar of Burnt-Offering, where the Morning and Evening-Sacrifices were daily conſumed, ſtood in this Tribe.

               <p>Ver. 28. <hi>All theſe are the twelve Tribes of Iſrael.</hi>] From theſe ſprang the Twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> Or, theſe are the Bleſſings of the Twelve Tribes: For theſe words plainly ſhow, that what he had ſaid, was not to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in their Perſons, but in their Poſterity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And bleſſed them; every one according to his bleſſing,</hi> &amp;c.] He did not give them a new Bleſſing after all this: But the meaning is, he bleſſed them (in the manner fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going) every one according to the Bleſſing deſigned by God for them. There ſeems indeed to be no Benediction beſtowed on the <hi>three</hi> firſt Tribes; but that is to be underſtood only comparatively: For he provided for them all a Portion in the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan.</hi>

                  <pb n="632" facs="tcp:50230:324"/> becauſe he would not have them miſtake it, when they went to bury him: And that he might ſhow his Title to it, if the Inhabitants of <hi>Canaan</hi> (from which he had been abſent ſome Years) ſhould diſpute the laying his Body there.</p>

And indeed it is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable he endeavoured to put himſelf into a Poſture of Authority at leaſt: And therefore <hi>ſat</hi> on his Bed-ſide while he ſpake. And now the Prophetick Spirit, which had raiſed his Natural Spirits above their ordinary pitch, departing from him, they preſently ſunk ſo much the lower; and in a ſhort time he expired.</p>

Upon the Firſt Rank of Funerals they ſpent a Talent of Silver: The Second coſt about twenty Pound: About the Third they made ſmall Expence, as

               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>And forty Days were fulfilled for him.</hi>] That is, for his Embalming: Which could not be finiſhed in a little time. For
<hi>Diodorus</hi> tells us of ſeveral Officers who were employed about it, one after another: And ſays expreſly they ſpent more than <hi>thirty</hi> Days in it. Which differs ſomething from what is here related: But, it is likely, in future Times (when <hi>Diodorus</hi> lived) they might have attained to a greater Perfection in this Art; and made their Spices penetrate the whole Body in leſs than <hi>forty</hi> Days, but more than <hi>thirty.</hi> And

<hi>i. e.</hi> All that time they were preparing his Body, in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner before-related, for its Funeral: Which <hi>Herodotus</hi> ſays, was juſt LXX Days. He alſo and <hi>Diodorus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe their manner of Mourning; and ſay that they daubed their Heads with Mud (as the <hi>Jews</hi> ſprinkled Aſhes on their Heads) and went about lamenting till the Corps was buried: Abſtaining from Bathing, and from Wine, and from all delicate Food, or fine Clothes. Which latter part of their Mourning, it's likely, might be in uſe in <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s time; though not the former, of beſmearing their Heads and Faces with Mud. But it is ſufficient to ſay that they appeared in the Habit of Mourners, (all the time the Body was Embalming) which was very various in different times and places: And continued in ſome Countries a great many Days longer, than in others. This time of LXX Days may ſeem to ſome too long: But <hi>Jacobus Capellus</hi> propoſes this to their Conſideration (<hi>Hiſt. Exot. &amp; Sacra. ad A. M.</hi> 2310.) that
<hi>Joſeph</hi> being next to their King, the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> honoured his Father with a Royal Funeral, and a Mourning of LXX Days: Which he thinks is a round Number for <hi>Seventy two:</hi> For <hi>Diodorus</hi> ſays ſo many were the Days of Mourning for their King.
<q rend="inline margSglQuotes">It ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reaſonable to them, that as they gave the <hi>Fifth</hi> part of the increaſe of their Land, to their King when <pb n="637" facs="tcp:50230:326"/> he was alive; ſo they ſhould beſtow the
<hi>Fifth</hi> part of the Year upon him, in Mourning for him when he was dead: Which was juſt LXXII, not reckoning the five odd Days, which did not come into their account.

<hi>Iſraelites</hi> afterward. Why <hi>Joſeph</hi> paſſed this way, which was very much about; and not the direct Road, which was a great deal ſhorter, is hard to tell. Perhaps it was a better way for Chariots: For it is not probable they feared any oppoſition from the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> or
<hi>Edomites;</hi> with whom the Matter might have been concerted (as we now ſpeak) before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, if they had apprehended their paſſage would meet with any hindrance from them.</p>

                  <hi>There they mourned,</hi> &amp;c.] Wherein this <hi>great and ſore lamentation</hi> conſiſted, we are not able to give a certain account: But, in after-times, they ſat with their Faces covered; having Aſhes ſprinkled on their Heads; crying out with a mournful Voice; ſometimes wring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſometimes clapping their Hands together; ſmiting
<pb n="641" facs="tcp:50230:328"/> their Breaſts, or their Thighs; with many other expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Grief and Sorrow. But why they made this Lamentation at the Floor of <hi>Atad,</hi> rather than at the Grave, is harder to reſolve. Perhaps it was a more convenient place to ſtay in <hi>ſeven</hi> Days, than that where he was to be buried: And the Mourning being made in the Country where the Body was laid, was the ſame as if it had been made at the Grave. Or, it was the Faſhion, perhaps, at the very entrance of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where they carried a Corps to be buried, to fall into a Lamentation: And they made the ſame again, when they came to the Place where it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred: Though there is nothing of that here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>

Some think this Meſſage was ſent before they went to bury their Father; while the time of Mourning laſted: When <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Heart, they thought, was tender, and his Father freſh in memory.

               <p>Ver. 18. <hi>And his Brethren alſo went,</hi> &amp;c.] The Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger acquainting them, how he ſtood affected to them; and, it's likely, carrying back a kind Meſſage from him, and an Invitation to come to him; they went to his Houſe and humbled themſelves at his Feet. In which
<hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Dream was ſtill further ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We are thy Servants.</hi>] They had not yet overcome their Fear (ſo cloſe did their Guilt ſtick to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences) and therefore call themſelves his <hi>Servants;</hi> not his <hi>Brethren.</hi> They had ſold him to be a Servant; and now they offer themſelves to be ſo to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="644" facs="tcp:50230:330"/>Ver. 19. <hi>For am I in the place of God?</hi>] His Father <hi>Jacob</hi> had ſaid the ſame to <hi>Rachel,</hi> XXX. 2. to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade her to ſubmit to Divine Providence: Which ſeems to be the ſcope of the words here. <hi>Shall I preſume to oppoſe my ſelf to what is come to paſs: As if I were God, and not He, who hath ordered things ſo much for our Good?</hi> This appears to be the Sence by what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows: And may be thus expreſſed; <hi>Shall I puniſh you for that</hi> (for that may be meant by being in the <hi>place of God,</hi> to whom Vengeance belongs) <hi>which God hath turned ſo much to all our Advantage?</hi> Though the words may be ſimply rendred, <hi>I am in the place of God,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Interrogation. As much as to ſay, <hi>I have nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed and ſuſtained you all this while, and can you think I will now do you hurt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 20. <hi>But as for you, ye thought evil againſt me,</hi> &amp;c.] It is true indeed, ye thought to deſtroy me: But God deſigned by that very evil contrivance of yours, to bring about the greateſt Good both to you and me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To bring to paſs, as it is this Day,</hi> &amp;c.] To accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh what you now ſee, the Preſervation of our whole Family: Which he underſtands by <hi>much People,</hi> in the next words, who by this means were <hi>ſaved</hi> from pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing. Herein appears the wonderful Wiſdom of God's Over-ruling Providence: Which, contrary to the Nature of Sin, and the Will of Sinners, turns the Evil they do into Good: And directs it to the moſt excellent Ends.</p>
               <p>Ver. 21. <hi>Now therefore fear you not.</hi>] He again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages their Hope; by repeating what he had ſaid, <hi>verſe</hi>
19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will nouriſh you,</hi> &amp;c.] I will ſtill take care of you all, as I have done hitherto.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="645" facs="tcp:50230:330"/>
                  <hi>And he comforted them,</hi> &amp;c.] With ſuch Diſcourſe as this, he raiſed up their drooping Spirits: For he ſpake moſt kindly to them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 22. <hi>And Joſeph dwelt in Egypt,</hi> &amp;c.] He conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in <hi>Egypt;</hi> and ſo did his Brethren, to their dying Day. And, no doubt, made his Word good to them: Being one of the greateſt Examples of Heroick Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: To which none can arrive, unleſs they be meek and placable as he was. For, <hi>Nihil eſt magnum, quod non idem ſit placidum;</hi> as <hi>Seneca</hi> truly ſaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Joſeph lived an hundred and ten Years.</hi>] Not ſo long as his Fore-fathers; for he was the Son of his Father's old Age, and lived a great part of his time full of Thought and Care: Having the Weight of a great Kingdom's Affairs lying on him. For <hi>eighty</hi> of theſe Years he ſpent in <hi>Egypt</hi> (being but <hi>thirty</hi> Years old when he firſt ſtood before <hi>Pharaoh</hi>) in great Proſperity indeed; but in no leſs ſolicitude to diſcharge ſo great a Truſt as was committed to him.</p>
               <p>Ver. 23. <hi>Ephraims Children of the third Generation.</hi>]
<hi>i. e.</hi> His great Grand-Children. In which <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on began to be fulfilled, XLVIII. 19, 20. XLIX. 25. We find indeed that after
<hi>Joſeph</hi>'s death (I ſuppoſe) <hi>Ephraim</hi> had ſome of his Children ſlain, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> VII. 21, &amp;c. But God ſo bleſſed thoſe who remained, that when <hi>Moſes</hi> took an account of them after their coming out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> they were increaſed to above <hi>eight thouſand,</hi> more than the Children of <hi>Manaſſeh, Numb.</hi> I. 33,
35.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brought up upon Joſeph's Knees.</hi>] He lived to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace and dandle them (as we now ſpeak) in which old Men and Women much delight.
<hi>Machir</hi> had on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Gilead</hi> by his firſt Wife; but he had more Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by a ſecond, as we read 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> VII. 16. All which were born before <hi>Joſeph</hi> died; and, perhaps, <pb n="646" facs="tcp:50230:331"/> by
<hi>Children</hi> he means the Children of his Grand-Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s great Authority, and his Children's great Increaſe, over-awed his Brethren ſo that they never durſt diſpute their Father's Will: In which he gave a double Portion unto them. Which one would gueſs by their Temper, was as diſpleaſing to them, as their Father's Kindneſs to <hi>Joſeph</hi> anciently had been: But they durſt not oppoſe it; nor do we find they quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled at it.</p>
               <p>Ver. 24. <hi>God will ſurely viſit you.</hi>] He explains his meaning by what follows; <hi>and bring you out of this Land,</hi> &amp;c. For the word <hi>viſit</hi> is uſed indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly either for beſtowing good things, or inflicting evil. Thus he died in the ſame Faith with his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors: That God would make good his Promiſes to them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 25. <hi>And Joſeph took an Oath.</hi>] As his Father had done of him, XLVII. 30, 31.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of the Children of Iſrael.</hi>] Not only of his Brethren mentioned before, <hi>verſe</hi> 24. but of all their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who were to ſucceed them; and might live (when his Brethren were dead) to carry his Body out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> which he deſired, for the ſame reaſon his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Carry up my Bones from hence.</hi>] He did not deſire to be carried immediately after his death, as his Father was when his Embalming was finiſhed; but that they ſhould carry him when they themſelves returned to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan:</hi> By which time he knew his Fleſh would be quite dried up, and nothing left but Bones. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why he did not deſire to be carried away preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, was, that his Body remaining with them, they might look upon it as a Pledge and ſecurity of the Promiſe
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:50230:331"/> God had made, of giving them the Poſſeſſion of that Land; wherein he deſired to be buried, or not buried at all. But he had repeated it twice, that God would <hi>ſurely viſit them,</hi> (<hi>verſe</hi> 24, 25.) and was ſo confident of it, that he deſired to be kept unburied, till the time of that Viſitation. Perhaps alſo he conſidered that they could not be of ſuch Authority, as he had been; to prevail to have his Body carried to <hi>Canaan,</hi> as his Father's was: And therefore deſired them not to think of laying him there; till that time came, when they ſhould make a ſolemn and univerſal departure thither.</p>
               <p>We read nothing what became of the reſt of his Brethren, but
<hi>Joſephus</hi> ſaith they were all carried in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Land of
<hi>Canaan</hi> to be buried: For they had the ſame deſire, in all likelihood, and gave the ſame charge concerning their Bodies; to keep Poſterity in hope, that God would certainly bring them thither. Which the words of St. <hi>Stephen</hi> alſo may ſeem to import; when he ſaith
<hi>Acts</hi> VII. 15, 16. <hi>Jacob died, and our Fathers, and were carried over into Sichem,</hi> &amp;c. though we read of none of their Fathers beſide
<hi>Joſeph;</hi> yet it ſeems the Tradition was, that they were all carried thither, after his Example. And ſo St. <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaith, That he ſaw at <hi>Sichem</hi> the Sepulchres of the XII Patriarchs. <hi>Epitaph. Paulae, cap.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>Ver. 26. <hi>So Joſeph died.</hi>] After he had taken the fore-named Oath of them, and aſſured them again of the Truth of God's Promiſe: Which were the laſt things he did.</p>
               <p>Some, perhaps, may think it ſtrange that ſo wiſe and great a Man as <hi>Joſeph,</hi> whoſe dying words, one cannot but think, would have left a deep impreſſion upon his Brethren, ſhould not give them abundance of good <pb n="648" facs="tcp:50230:332"/> Counſel at his departure from this World: And lay ſome other Charge upon them, beſides this of carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up his Bones to the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> But <hi>Moſes</hi> did not intend to write all that excellent Men ſaid and did: And we may very well think, when he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his ſtedfaſt Faith in the Promiſe made to
<hi>Abraham</hi> (which the Apoſtle takes notice of, <hi>Hebr.</hi> XI. 22.) and aſſured them God would perform it; he enlarged himſelf on that Subject, in more words than are here related.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Being an hundred and ten Years old.</hi>] This was ſaid before, <hi>verſe</hi> 22. but here repeated to ſignifie he did not live a Year beyond it; and ſo died juſt <hi>fifty four</hi> Years after his Father; and an <hi>hundred forty four</hi> Years before their departure out of
<hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And they embalmed him.</hi>] His Brethren took the ſame care of his Body, that he had done of his Father's, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. See there. For that <hi>Joſeph</hi> died before any of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, the <hi>Jews</hi> gather from <hi>Exod.</hi> I. 6. where it's ſaid, <hi>Joſeph died, and all his Brethren.</hi> He firſt, and they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him. But not content with this, ſome of them ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to tell us how many Years every one of them lived; nay, the very Month and Day of their Birth, as may be ſeen in <hi>R. Bechai. Reuben,</hi> for inſtance, they ſay was born the XIV Day of
<hi>Ciſleu,</hi> and died when he was CXXV Years old, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he was put in a Coffin in Egypt.</hi>] To be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in that <hi>Cheſt</hi> or <hi>Ark</hi> (as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word is commonly tranſlated) till they themſelves went from thence.
<hi>Herodotus</hi> in the Book above-named (<hi>Euterpe cap.</hi> 86, 90.) ſpeaks of the <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>Cheſts</hi> wherein dead Bodies were incloſed after their Embalming: Which they laid <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in the Houſe or Cell where theſe Cheſts were repoſited, reared againſt the Wall of
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:50230:332"/> it. Whether <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Coffin was put into ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Repoſitory, or, rather, preſerved in a place by it ſelf, we cannot determine. But the <hi>Chaldee</hi> hath an odd Conceit (as <hi>G. Schikkard</hi> obſerves in his <hi>Jus Regium, p.</hi> 159.) that it was kept in the River <hi>Nile.</hi> Which aroſe, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, from a miſtake of the relation which that Author had met withal, of the Place where they laid their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: Which were let down very deep <hi>Wells,</hi> or <hi>Vaults</hi> ſome call them (ſome of which were not far from the River <hi>Nile</hi>) and ſo put into a <hi>Cave,</hi> which was at the bottom of thoſe
<hi>Wells.</hi> For ſo <hi>F. Vanſleb</hi> and others who have gone to ſearch for <hi>Mummies,</hi> deſcribe the Places where they lie: And tell us they found ſome of the <hi>Coffins</hi> made of Wood (not putrefied to this Day) and others of Clothes paſted together, <hi>forty</hi> times double; which were as ſtrong as Wood, and not at all rotten.</p>
               <p>The Reader cannot but obſerve, That from the time of
<hi>Joſeph</hi>'s advancement to the Government, till the time of his death,
<hi>i. e.</hi> for LXXX Years, there is no mention of the death of any King in
<hi>Egypt.</hi> For it was not <hi>Moſes</hi> his Intention to write the Hiſtory of that Kingdom, or to give us the Series of their Kings: But only to acquaint us with the Series of the Patriarchs, and give ſome account of them, from the Creation to his own time. All other things muſt be learnt out of other Authors. And, according to <hi>Euſebius,</hi> whom <hi>Jac. Capellus</hi> follows, the firſt King of the XVIIIth. <hi>Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſty</hi> (when the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Hiſtory he makes account ceaſed to be fabulous) was <hi>Amos:</hi> Whoſe Dream <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> interpreted, and was by him preferred. After he had reigned XXV Years he left the Kingdom to
<hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bros;</hi> who reigned XIII Years. Next to whom was <hi>Amenophis</hi> (as much as to ſay, a Servant of <hi>Noph,</hi> i. e. <pb n="650" facs="tcp:50230:333"/>
                  <hi>Memphis</hi>) who reigned XXI Years: And then left the Kingdom to
<hi>Mephres,</hi> who held it XII Years. To whom <hi>Joſephus,</hi> out of
<hi>Manetho,</hi> ſubſtitutes <hi>Amerſis,</hi> and ſays he reigned XXII Years. And then ſucceeded <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phramuthoſis,</hi> who reigned XXVI Years: In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of whoſe time <hi>Joſeph</hi> died.</p>
